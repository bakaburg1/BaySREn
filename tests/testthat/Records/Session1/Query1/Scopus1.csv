We consider a mathematical model that takes into account two forms of rehabilitation, namely; inpatient and outpatient. We examine the trends of these two types of rehabilitation. We also seek to investigate the global dynamics of the developed methamphetamine epidemic model. Methods: The model is designed by likening the initiation process to an infection that spreads in a community through interactions between methamphetamine users and non-users. We make use of Lyapunov functions obtained from a suitable combination of common quadratic and Volterra-type functions to establish the global stability of the methamphetamine-persistent steady state. The least squares curve fit routine (lsqcurvefit) in Matlab with optimization is used to estimate the parameter values. Results: The model analysis shows that the model has two equilibria, the methamphetamine free equilibrium and the methamphetamine persistent equilibrium, that are both globally stable when the threshold $$\mathcal {R}-a<1$$ R a < 1 and $$\mathcal {R}-a>1$$ R a > 1, respectively. Upon fitting the model to data on drug users under rehabilitation, parameter values that give the best fit were obtained. The projections carried out the long term trends of these forms of rehabilitation. Conclusion: The results suggest that inpatient rehabilitation programs have an increased potential of enhancing the chances of recovery for methamphetamine addicts. © 2015 Mushanyu et al.",Inpatient rehabilitation; Least squares curve fitting; Methamphetamine; Outpatient rehabilitation; Reproduction number,"central stimulant agent; methamphetamine; Amphetamine-Related Disorders; hospital patient; outcome assessment; outpatient; South Africa; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Amphetamine-Related Disorders; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Inpatients; Methamphetamine; Models, Statistical; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Outpatients; South Africa",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950252162

This paper describes the factors correlated with mastitis and investigates the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in women who participated in the CASTLE (Candida and Staphylococcus Transmission: Longitudinal Evaluation) study. The CASTLE study was a prospective cohort study which recruited nulliparous women in late pregnancy in two maternity hospitals in Melbourne, Australia in 2009-2011. Methods: Women completed questionnaires at recruitment and six time-points in the first eight weeks postpartum. Postpartum questionnaires asked about incidences of mastitis, nipple damage, milk supply, expressing practices and breastfeeding problems. Nasal and nipple swabs were collected from mothers and babies, as well as breast milk samples. All samples were cultured for S. aureus. ""Time at risk"" of mastitis was defined as days between birth and first occurrence of mastitis (for women who developed mastitis) and days between birth and the last study time-point (for women who did not develop mastitis). Risk factors for incidence of mastitis occurring during the time at risk (Incident Rate Ratios [IRR]) were investigated using a discrete version of the multivariable proportional hazards regression model. Results: Twenty percent (70/346) of participants developed mastitis. Women had an increased risk of developing mastitis if they reported nipple damage (IRR 2.17, 95 % CI 1.21, 3.91), over-supply of breast milk (IRR 2.60, 95 % CI 1.58, 4.29), nipple shield use (IRR 2.93, 95 % CI 1.72, 5.01) or expressing several times a day (IRR 1.64, 95 % CI 1.01, 2.68). The presence of S. aureus on the nipple (IRR 1.72, 95 % CI 1.04, 2.85) or in milk (IRR 1.78, 95 % CI 1.08, 2.92) also increased the risk of developing mastitis. Conclusions: Nipple damage, over-supply of breast milk, use of nipple shields and the presence of S. aureus on the nipple or in breast milk increased the mastitis risk in our prospective cohort study sample. Reducing nipple damage may help reduce maternal breast infections. © 2015 Cullinane et al.",Breast infection; Breastfeeding; Mastitis; Staphylococcus aureus,adolescent; adult; adverse effects; breast feeding; Candida albicans; candidiasis; clinical trial; female; follow up; human; incidence; isolation and purification; mastitis; microbiology; middle aged; multicenter study; pregnancy; prospective study; puerperium; questionnaire; risk factor; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Victoria; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Breast Feeding; Candida albicans; Candidiasis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Mastitis; Middle Aged; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Surveys and Questionnaires; Victoria; Young Adult,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949995125

The 2014 West African outbreaks are the largest and worst in history. There is no specific treatment or effective/safe vaccine against the disease. Hence, control efforts are restricted to basic public health preventive (non-pharmaceutical) measures. Such efforts are undermined by traditional/cultural belief systems and customs, characterized by general mistrust and skepticism against government efforts to combat the disease. This study assesses the roles of traditional customs and public healthcare systems on the disease spread. Methods: A mathematical model is designed and used to assess population-level impact of basic non-pharmaceutical control measures on the 2014 Ebola outbreaks. The model incorporates the effects of traditional belief systems and customs, along with disease transmission within health-care settings and by Ebola-deceased individuals. A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine model parameters that most affect disease transmission. The model is parameterized using data from Guinea, one of the three Ebola-stricken countries. Numerical simulations are performed and the parameters that drive disease transmission, with or without basic public health control measures, determined. Three effectiveness levels of such basic measures are considered. Results: The distribution of the basic reproduction number (R0) for Guinea (in the absence of basic control measures) is such that R0 ∈ [0.77, 1.35], for the case when the belief systems do not result in more unreported Ebola cases. When such systems inhibit control efforts, the distribution increases to R0 ∈ [1.15, 2.05]. The total Ebola cases are contributed by Ebola-deceased individuals (22%), symptomatic individuals in the early (33%) and latter (45%) infection stages. A significant reduction of new Ebola cases can be achieved by increasing health-care workers' daily shifts from 8 to 24 hours, limiting hospital visitation to 1 hour and educating the populace to abandon detrimental traditional/cultural belief systems. Conclusions: The 2014 outbreaks are controllable using a moderately-effective basic public health intervention strategy alone. A much higher (&gt;50%) disease burden would have been recorded in the absence of such intervention. © 2015 Agusto et al.",Community; Ebola; Health-care workers; Hospital; Quarantine,"Article; basic reproduction number; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; disease association; early infection stage; Ebola deceased individual; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; epidemic; general aspects of disease; Guinea; health belief; health care system; health education; human; infection control; infection risk; latter infection stage; limiting hospital visitation; mass communication; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical model; miscellaneous named groups; nonhuman; numerical simulation; risk reduction; sensitivity analysis; simulation; social aspect; symptomatic individual; traditional belieef; traditional customs; virus transmission; working time; cultural anthropology; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; procedures; public health; theoretical model; transmission; Culture; Disease Outbreaks; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Public Health",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928817990

Sustaining the innovation requires early adoption of a coherent implementation strategy. Using an example from clinical education, this article describes a process used to implement a large-scale innovation with the intent of achieving sustainability. Desire to improve the effectiveness of undergraduate medical education has led to growing support for a longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC) model. This involves a move away from the traditional clerkship of 'block rotations' with frequent changes in disciplines, to a focus upon clerkships with longer duration and opportunity for students to build sustained relationships with supervisors, mentors, colleagues and patients. A growing number of medical schools have adopted the LIC model for a small percentage of their students. At a time when increasing medical school numbers and class sizes are leading to competition for clinical supervisors it is however a daunting challenge to provide a longitudinal clerkship for an entire medical school class. This challenge is presented to illustrate the strategy used to implement sustainable large scale innovation. What was done: A strategy to implement and build a sustainable longitudinal integrated community-based clerkship experience for all students was derived from a framework arising from Roberto and Levesque's research in business. The framework's four core processes: chartering, learning, mobilising and realigning, provided guidance in preparing and rolling out the 'whole of class' innovation. Discussion: Roberto and Levesque's framework proved useful for identifying the foundations of the implementation strategy, with special emphasis on the relationship building required to implement such an ambitious initiative. Although this was innovation in a new School it required change within the school, wider university and health community. Challenges encountered included some resistance to moving away from traditional hospital-centred education, initial student concern, resource limitations, workforce shortage and potential burnout of the innovators. Summary: Large-scale innovations in medical education may productively draw upon research from other disciplines for guidance on how to lay the foundations for successfully achieving sustainability. © 2015 Hudson et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Community-based; Large scale change; Longitudinal integrated clerkships; Medical education,"clinical education; community medicine; curriculum; education; educational model; health care planning; human; longitudinal study; mass communication; medical education; New South Wales; organization and management; program evaluation; Clinical Clerkship; Community Medicine; Curriculum; Diffusion of Innovation; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Health Plan Implementation; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Educational; New South Wales; Program Evaluation",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938888935

Methods: End-user changes in health-seeking behavior in ANC and postnatal care (PNC) were investigated following registration of 800 women into APAS. These investigations employed interviews of pregnant women or new mothers (n = 67) and CHWs (n = 20). Ordinal logistic regressions and exact binomial tests were used in the routine data analyses (n = 650, health registers). Results: All CHWs interviewed agreed that APAS helped them track pregnant woman efficiently, compared to paper-based tracking forms. Women registered in APAS reported that CHWs reminded them of appointments more regularly than before its inception. The routine data analysis showed that among women who had their 1st ANC visit in the 2nd trimester, women who resided in the MVP cluster and were in APAS had: 3 times the odds of going for more ANC visits compared to women who were not registered (but resided in the cluster), after adjusting for the mother's HIV status in the multivariate model (Adjusted OR = 2.58, 95% CI [1.10-6.01]); twice the odds of going for more ANC visits compared to women who were not registered and resided outside the cluster (Adjusted OR = 2.37, 95% CI [0.99-5.67]) Among women not registered, residence inside or outside the cluster did not affect the number of ANC visits made (Adjusted OR = 0.86, 95% CI [0.45-1.69]). The APAS also greatly increased the likelihood of women making the 6 recommended post-delivery baby follow-ups. For women registered in APAS, the MTCT rate at 18 months was significantly different from that of women not registered, and from the global rate of 30%. Women not registered had a 9% MTCT rate at 18 months regardless of residence, while women registered had a 0% transmission rate at both 9 and 18 months. Conclusions: The incorporation of mHealth tools in CHW programs can improve adherence to ANC and PNC and enhance PMTCT efforts. © 2015 Mushamiri et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",ANC; CHWs; HIV; Kenya; mHealth; PMTCT,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; adolescent; adult; delivery; female; government; health auxiliary; health service; HIV Infections; hospital management; human; infant; Kenya; mother; newborn; organization and management; patient attitude; pregnancy; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; telemedicine; text messaging; transmission; vertical transmission; young adult; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adolescent; Adult; Appointments and Schedules; Community Health Workers; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Government Programs; HIV Infections; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Kenya; Maternal Health Services; Mothers; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pregnancy; Telemedicine; Text Messaging; Young Adult",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928652767

The best strategy for controlling extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) transmission in intensive care units (ICUs) remains elusive. objective. We developed a stochastic transmission model to quantify the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing the spread of ESBL-PE in an ICU. methods. We modeled the evolution of an outbreak caused by the admission of a single carrier in a 10-bed ICU free of ESBL-PE. Using data obtained from recent muticenter studies, we studied 26 strategies combining different levels of the following 3 interventions: (1) increasing healthcare worker compliance with hand hygiene before and after contact with a patient; (2) cohorting; (3) reducing antibiotic prevalence at admission with or without reducing antibiotherapy duration. results. Improving hand hygiene compliance from 55% before patient contact and 60% after patient contact to 80% before and 80% after patient contact reduced the nosocomial incidence rate of ESBL-PE colonization by 91% at 90 days. Adding cohorting to hand hygiene improvement intervention decreased the proportion of ESBL-PE acquisitions by an additional 7%. Antibiotic restriction had the lowest impact on the epidemic. When combined with other interventions, it only marginally improved effectiveness, despite strong hypotheses regarding antibiotic impact on transmission. conclusion.

Various transmission routes contribute to spread of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in hospitalized patients. Patients with readmissions during which CRKP is again isolated (“CRKP readmission”) potentially contribute to transmission of CRKP. objective.

Multicenter consortium of acute care hospitals in the Great Lakes region. patients. All patients who were discharged alive during the study period were included. Each patient was included only once at the time of the first CRKP-positive culture. methods. All readmissions within 90 days of discharge from the index hospitalization during which CRKP was again found were analyzed. Risk factors for CRKP readmission were evaluated in multivariable models. results. Fifty-six (20%) of 287 patients who were discharged alive had a CRKP readmission. History of malignancy was associated with CRKP readmission (adjusted odds ratio [adjusted OR], 3.00 [95% CI, 1.32-6.65], P<.01). During the index hospitalization, 160 patients (56%) received antibiotic treatment against CRKP; the choice of regimen was associated with CRKP readmission (P =.02). Receipt of tigecycline-based therapy (adjusted OR, 5.13 [95% CI, 1.72-17.44], using aminoglycoside-based therapy as a reference in those treated with anti-CRKP antibiotics) was associated with CRKP readmission. conclusion. Hospitalized patients with CRKP—specifically those with a history of malignancy—are at high risk of readmission with recurrent CRKP infection or colonization. Treatment during the index hospitalization with a tigecycline-based regimen increases this risk. © 2015 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

Methods: From December 2012 to October 2013, eight carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii were detected at Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark. These isolates were typed by PFGE, with ApaI and SmaI, respectively, and subjected to WGS. The WGS data were used for in silico extraction of MLST types using two different schemes, resistance genes and SNPs, to which 31 publicly available A. baumannii genomes were added. Results: Using ApaI, the eight isolates had four different PFGE profiles, which were further differentiated using SmaI, separating one of the profiles into two distinct PFGE types. Five ST2 (Pasteur MLST) OXA-23-producing isolates, two ST1 OXA-72-producing isolates and one ST158 OXA-23-producing isolate were detected. The five ST2 isolates were subdivided into ST195, ST208 and ST218 using the Oxford MLST scheme. The phylogenetic analysis based on the core genome showed that six of the eight Danish A. baumannii isolates were located in three distinct clusters. The two remaining isolates did not cluster with other Danish or international isolates included in the study. Isolates that clustered using PFGE, Oxford MLST and phylogenetic analysis also shared similar resistance gene profiles. Conclusions: The SNP profile, Oxford MLST, PFGE and resistance gene profiles clearly indicated spread of three different A. baumannii strains. © The Author 2015.

Objectives: To estimate the incidence of switching from non-injected heroin use (usually smoking or ""chasing"") to injection and to investigate the risk factors for this change. Methods: We reviewed the socio-demographic and clinical data of 7305 heroin-dependent patients treated at a detoxification clinic of a university-affiliated psychiatric hospital in China from January 2000 to February 2009. Results: Within 1 year, the majority of non-injection drug users (NIDUs) transitioned to IDUs (59.4% within 6 months and 76.7% within 12 months). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that marital status, years of education, employment status, age at onset of heroin use, duration of drug abuse, and initial dose were associated with the switch from NIDU to IDU. Being married (B = -0.410, OR = 0.664), being employed (B = -0.243, OR = 0.784), and older age at onset (B = -0.040, OR = 0.961) were protective factors. More education (B = 0.120, OR = 1.128), longer duration of drug abuse (B = 0.010, OR = 1.010), and a higher dose at initial drug use (B = 0.234, OR = 1.264) were risk factors. Conclusions/Importance: The study has identified several risk factors for the switch to injection among heroin users. Understanding these factors can help design new approaches to more specifically target high-risk populations and high-risk behaviors to delay or prevent the transition to injection. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",China; heroin; injection drug users; route of drug administration; transition,"adult; China; complication; demography; female; hepatitis C; heroin dependence; HIV Infections; human; incidence; inhalational drug administration; longitudinal study; male; risk factor; statistical model; substance abuse; syphilis; university hospital; Academic Medical Centers; Administration, Inhalation; Adult; China; Demography; Female; Hepatitis C; Heroin Dependence; HIV Infections; Humans; Incidence; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Risk Factors; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Syphilis",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951287672

Rapid and precise identification of MRSA carriage in combination with targeted hygienic management are proven to be effective but incur relevant extra costs. Therefore, health care providers have to decide which MRSA screening strategy and which diagnostic technology should be applied according to economic criteria. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine which MRSA admission screening and infection control management strategy causes the lowest expected cost for a hospital. Focus was set on the Point-of-Care Testing (PoC). Methods: A decision tree analytic cost model was developed, primarily based on data from peer-reviewed literature. In addition, univariate sensitivity analyses of the different input parameters were conducted to study the robustness of the results. Findings: In the basic analysis, risk-based PoC screening showed the highest mean cost savings with 14.98 € per admission in comparison to no screening. Rapid universal screening methods became favorable at high MRSA prevalence, while in situations with low MRSA transmission rates omission of screening may be favorable. Conclusion: Early detection of MRSA by rapid PoC or PCR technologies and consistent implementation of appropriate hygienic measures lead to high economic efficiency of MRSA management. Whether general or targeted screening is more efficient depends mainly on epidemiological and infrastructural parameters. © 2015 Hübner et al.",Admission screening; Cost; Decision tree analysis; Hospital; Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; Point-of-care,Article; bacterial transmission; bacterium culture; bacterium detection; controlled study; cost control; decision tree; hospital admission; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection; point of care testing; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; screening test; sensitivity analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006216611

Case diagnoses during the epidemic have relied on polymerase chain reaction-based tests. Owing to limited laboratory capacity and local transport infrastructure, the delays from sample collection to test results being available have often been 2 days or more. Point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests offer the potential to substantially reduce these delays. We review Ebola rapid diagnostic tests approved by the World Health Organization and those currently in development. Such rapid diagnostic tests could allow early triaging of patients, thereby reducing the potential for nosocomial transmission. In addition, despite the lower test accuracy, rapid diagnostic test-based diagnosis may be beneficial in some contexts because of the reduced time spent by uninfected individuals in health-care settings where they may be at increased risk of infection; this also frees up hospital beds. We use mathematical modelling to explore the potential benefits of diagnostic testing strategies involving rapid diagnostic tests alone and in combination with polymerase chain reaction testing. Our analysis indicates that the use of rapid diagnostic tests with sensitivity and specificity comparable with those currently under development always enhances control, whether evaluated at a health-care-unit or population level. If such tests had been available throughout the recent epidemic, we estimate, for Sierra Leone, that their use in combination with confirmatory polymerase chain-reaction testing might have reduced the scale of the epidemic by over a third.This article has not been written or reviewed by Nature editors.

State AIDS Control Societies (SACSs) encourage private hospitals to set up integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs). However, private hospitals of Delhi did not set up ICTCs. Consequently, there is no information on PMTCT interventions in private hospitals of Delhi. This study was undertaken by Delhi SACS during March 2013 through September 2013 to assess status of implementation of PMTCT programme in various private hospitals of Delhi to assist programme managers in framing national policy to facilitate uniform implementation of National PMTCT guidelines. Out of total 575 private hospitals registered with Government of Delhi, 336 (58.4%) catering to pregnant women were identified. About 100 private hospitals with facility of antenatal care, vaginal/caesarean delivery and postnatal care and minimum 10 indoor beds were selected for study. Study sample comprised of large corporate hospitals (≥100 beds; n = 29), medium-sized hospitals (25 to <100 beds; n = 42) and small nursing homes (10 to <25 beds; n = 29). A pre-tested questionnaire was designed to obtain basic information about hospital in context to PMTCT programme. Interviews of heads of obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatric departments were conducted by trained interviewers. It was observed that in private hospitals in year 2012, out of 38,186 antenatal women tested, 52 (0.14%) were detected HIV-positive. However, against National Policy, HIV testing was done without pre/post-test counselling/or consent of women, no PMTCT protocol existed, delivery of HIV-positive women was not undertaken and no efforts were made to link HIV-positive women to antiretroviral treatment. Major intervention observed was medical termination of pregnancy, which indicates lack of awareness in private hospitals about available interventions under national programme. The role of private hospitals in management of HIV in pregnant women must be recognized and mainstreamed in HIV control efforts. There is an urgent need for capacity building of private health care providers to improve standards of practice.

These estimates parameterized a model used to evaluate the long-term impact of MupR on three mupirocin usage policies: 'clinical cases', 'screen and treat' and 'universal'. Strategies were assessed in terms of colonized and infected patient days and scenario and sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: The transmission probability of a MupS strain was 2.16 (95% CI 1.38-2.94) times that of a MupR strain in the absence of mupirocin usage. The total prevalence of MupR in colonized and infected MRSA patients after 5 years of simulation was 9.1% (95% CI 8.7%-9.6%) with the 'screen and treat' mupirocin policy, increasing to 21.3% (95% CI 20.9%-21.7%) with 'universal' mupirocin use. The prevalence of MupR increased in 50%-75% of simulations with 'universal' usage and >10% of simulations with 'screen and treat' usage in scenarios where MupS had a higher transmission probability than MupR.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence from a clinical setting of a fitness cost associated with MupR in MRSA strains. This provides a plausible explanation for the low levels of mupirocin resistance seen following 'screen and treat' mupirocin usage. From our simulations, even under conservative estimates of relative transmissibility, we see long-term increases in the prevalence of MupR given 'universal' use. © The Author 2015.

Safer, more effective, and more easily administered drugs are needed especially for severe, chronic, or unresponsive infections. The novel fungal CYP51 inhibitor VT-1161 demonstrated in vitro antifungal activity, with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 1 and 2 μg/ml, respectively, against 52 Coccidioides clinical isolates. In the initial animal study, oral doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg VT-1161 significantly reduced fungal burdens and increased survival time in a lethal respiratory model in comparison with treatment with a placebo (P&lt;0.001). Oral doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg VT-1161 were similarly efficacious in the murine central nervous system (CNS) model compared to placebo treatment (P&lt;0.001). All comparisons with the positive-control drug, fluconazole at 50 mg/kg per day, demonstrated either statistical equivalence or superiority of VT-1161. VT-1161 treatment also prevented dissemination of infection from the original inoculation site to a greater extent than fluconazole. Many of these in vivo results can be explained by the long half-life of VT-1161 leading to sustained high plasma levels. Thus, the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of VT-1161 are attractive characteristics for long-term treatment of this serious fungal infection. Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Our study aimed to provide evidence for transmission of Van A type resistance from the hospital to the community. Wild-type community and hospital associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were studied in vitro and in a model that mimicked a natural environment to ascertain their ability to acquire and maintain the vancomycin resistance determinant (Van A gene) from vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Fitness was assessed and the cost of Van A acquisition and retention was estimated. In vitro mating experiments were carried out using a filter mating technique and a model of a natural water body environment. Transfer of resistance was carried out in two different conditions: restricted and favorable. Transconjugants were confirmed by E test and PCR using specific primer sets. Growth kinetics and fitness measurements were done by spectrometric analysis. Using the in vitro filter mating technique, high transfer frequencies that ranged from 0.7 × 10–3(0.0006) to 3.1 × 10–4(0.00011) were recorded, with the highest transfer frequencies for CA MRSA (thermosensitively homogenous) (0.7 × 10–3), and 1.2 × 10–4 to 2.4 × 10–6 in the model. HA MRSA (homogenous) showed a greater capacity (3.6 × 10–4) to receive the Van A gene, while CA MRSA showed a reduced ability to maintain the gene after serial subcultures. CA and HA thermosensitively heterogeneous MRSA transconjugants exhibited higher growth rates. The present study provides evidence for the enhanced ability of CA and HA MRSA clones to acquire and maintain Van A type resistance. © 2015, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",fitness; growth kinetics; MRSA; resistance transfer; Van A resistance,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957442950

In 2014, the German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Control (KRINKO) released revised recommendations for the care of patients with MRSA. In particular, for rehabilitation facilities, these recommendations stipulated a medical risk analysis to establish necessary hygiene measures, and provide specific recommendations. Material and Methods: Based on a large investigation carried out in 21 rehabilitation facilities covering different medical specialties, medical risk analyses according to KRINKO were performed, and the findings evaluated separately for orthopedic, cardiologic, oncologic, neurologic, or geriatric facilities, as well as for all institutions taken together. Results: The overall colonization pressure, i. e. the point prevalence of MRSA and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative pathogens (ESBL) among hospitalized rehabilitation patients was found to be 0.7% and 7.7%, respectively. Impairment of the intact skin (an established risk factor for persisting MRSA colonization and MRSA infection) was found in 7% of the patients, impaired mobility requiring enhanced level of care in 4.1%, and mental confusion and/or incontinence (potentially impairing the application of hygiene measures) in 11% of patients. Compared to the total study population, there was an increase in all risk factors in geriatric and neurologic rehabilitation patients: skin barrier breaches (in neurologic and in geriatric patients: 18.3 and 19.2%, respectively), impaired mobility (32.7 and 37.0%, respectively), and mental confusion/incontinence (24.5 and 28.0%, respectively). In addition, geriatric patients demonstrated an increased overall prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MRSA: 9.4%; ESBL: 22.7%). Discussion: Risk analysis according to KRINKO showed that in rehabilitation facilities with internal medicine or orthopedics specialties, there was a comparably lower risk for transmission, colonization, and/or infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens, as against institutions with neurologic or geriatric specialty. It appears that in the first type of rehabilitation facilities, consistently carried out basic hygiene measures are sufficient while in neurologic or geriatric rehabilitation hospitals, these measures should be supplemented with additional hygiene measures based on medical risk analysis. Furthermore, for infection control purposes in rehabilitation facilities, patient isolation will be rarely necessary or appropriate. These analyses suggest that in the future, rehabilitation programs for MRSA/ESBL-colonized patients will be more successful. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",hygiene procedures; multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO); rehabilitation clinics; risk analysis; risk factors,"adolescent; adult; aged; Bacterial Infections; child; clinical trial; cross infection; devices; Equipment Contamination; female; Germany; human; hygiene; infant; male; microbiology; middle aged; multicenter study; multidrug resistance; newborn; preschool child; prevalence; procedures; rehabilitation center; risk assessment; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bacterial Infections; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross Infection; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Equipment and Supplies; Equipment Contamination; Female; Germany; Humans; Hygiene; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Rehabilitation Centers; Risk Assessment; Young Adult",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950111959

Despite sophisticated strategies and efforts, the antibiotic options for treating MRSA infection are narrowing because of the limited number of newly developed antimicrobials. Here, four newly-isolated MRSA-virulent phages, IME-SA1, IMESA2, IME-SA118 and IME-SA119, were sequenced and analyzed. Their genome termini were identified using our previously proposed ""termini analysis theory"". We provide evidence that remarkable conserved terminus sequences are found in IME-SA1/2/118/119, and, moreover, are widespread throughout Twortlikevirus Staphylococcus phage G1 and K species. Results also suggested that each phage of the two species has conserved 5′ terminus while the 3′ terminus is variable. More importantly, a variable region with a specific pattern was found to be present near the conserved terminus of Twortlikevirus S. phage G1 species. The clone with the longest variable region had variable terminus lengths in successive generations, while the clones with the shortest variable region and with the average length variable region maintained the same terminal length as themselves during successive generations. IME-SA1 bacterial infection experiments showed that the variation is not derived from adaptation of the phage to different host strains.

Treatment with antimicrobial agents has a significant impact on the intestinal resistome and leads to enhanced horizontal transfer and selection of resistance. We have monitored the development of intestinal ARGs over a 6-day course of ciprofloxacin (Cp) treatment in two healthy individuals by using sequenced-based metagenomics and different ARG quantification methods. Fixed- and random-effect models were applied to determine the change in ARG abundance per defined daily dose of Cp as an expression of the respective selection pressure. Among various shifts in the composition of the intestinal resistome, we found in one individual a strong positive selection for class D beta-lactamases which were partly located on a mobile genetic element. Furthermore, a trend to a negative selection has been observed with class A beta-lactamases (-2.66 hits per million sample reads/defined daily dose; P = 0.06). By 4 weeks after the end of treatment, the composition of ARGs returned toward their initial state but to a different degree in both subjects. We present here a novel analysis algorithm for the determination of antibiotic selection pressure which can be applied in clinical settings to compare therapeutic regimens regarding their effect on the intestinal resistome. This information is of critical importance for clinicians to choose antimicrobial agents with a low selective force on their patients' intestinal ARGs, likely resulting in a diminished spread of resistance and a reduced burden of hospital-acquired infections with multidrug-resistant pathogens. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

However, after longterm treatment with SXT, thymidine-dependent (TD) SXT-resistant small-colony variants (SCVs) emerge. In TD-SCVs, mutations of thymidylate synthase ([TS] thyA) occur. Until now, it has never been systematically investigated that SXT is triggering the induction and/or selection of TD-SCVs. In our study, we performed induction, reversion, and competition experiments in vitro and in vivo using a chronic mouse pneumonia model to determine the impact of SXT on the emergence of TD-SCVs. SCVs were characterized by light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and auxotrophism testing. Short-term exposure of S. aureus to SXT induced the TD-SCV phenotype in S. aureus SH1000, while selection of TD-SCVs with thyA mutations occurred after long-term exposure. In reversion experiments with clinical and laboratory TD-SCVs, all revertants carried compensating mutations at the initially identified mutation site. Competition experiments in vitro and in vivo revealed a survival and growth advantage of the ΔthyA mutant under low-thymidine availability and SXT exposure although this advantage was less profound in vivo. Our results show that SXT induces the TD-SCV phenotype after short-term exposure, while long-term exposure selects for thyA mutations, which provide an advantage for TD-SCVs under specified conditions. Thus, our results further an understanding of the dynamic processes occurring during SXT exposure with induction and selection of S. aureus TD-SCVs.
