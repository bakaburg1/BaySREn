1,IEEE:5970118,Agent-Based Modeling of the Spread of Influenza-Like Illness in an Emergency Department: A Simulation Study,"The objective of this paper was to develop an agent based modeling framework in order to simulate the spread of influenza virus infection on a layout based on a representative hospital emergency department in Winnipeg, Canada. In doing so, the study complements mathematical modeling techniques for disease spread, as well as modeling applications focused on the spread of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections in hospitals. Twenty different emergency department scenarios were simulated, with further simulation of four infection control strategies. The agent based modeling approach represents systems modeling, in which the emergency department was modeled as a collection of agents (patients and healthcare workers) and their individual characteristics, behaviors, and interactions. The framework was coded in C + + using Qt4 libraries running under the Linux operating system. A simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to analyze the data, in which the percentage of patients that be came infected in one day within the simulation was the dependent variable. The results suggest that within the given instance con text, patient-oriented infection control policies (alternate treatment streams, masking symptomatic patients) tend to have a larger effect than policies that target healthcare workers. The agent-based modeling framework is a flexible tool that can be made to reflect any given environment; it is also a decision support tool for practitioners and policymakers to assess the relative impact of infection control strategies. The framework illuminates scenarios worthy of further investigation, as well as counterintuitive findings.",10.1109/TITB.2011.2163414,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5970118/,M. Laskowski; B. C.

2,IEEE:7116969,Modeling nosocomial transmission of carbapenem-resistant bacteria,"Patient acquisition of carbapenem resistant bacteria in hospitals is a serious problem that leads to adverse outcomes for infected patients. The most common carbapenem resistance mechanism in US hospitals is a mobile gene called Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), which can move between bacterial species. Previous research has demonstrated that patient-to-patient transmission cannot fully account for all cases of KPC-positive bacterial transmission in hospital settings. The study in this paper considers environmental reservoirs as an additional source of transmission. We conduct this analysis with logistic regression and random forest models of nosocomial transmission that includes both environmental factors and clinical data. Results show that infection rates are not uniformly distributed throughout the hospital and that differences in room layout play a role. However, proximity to KPC-positive Enterobacteriaceae environmental reservoirs does not significantly correlate to patient acquisition.",10.1109/SIEDS.2015.7116969,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7116969/,J.

3,IEEE:7321250,Contact Networks and the Spread of MRSA in Stockholm Hospitals,"We have been studying the spread of meticillin (multi) resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). In the course of these studies, we investigated information about all patient visits within Stockholm County during the outbreak period, with registry over all diagnosed MRSA cases. As part of this project, we developed methods for analyzing the contact network of persons who had visited the same care facility, as well as methods for analyzing the affects of network structure on the transmission of MRSA. We also studied matrixes of disease transition in hospital populations (infected patients vs. Merely contagious patients). In the stationary case: (a) we have estimator matrixes of probabilities and other statistical properties of the contact networks. In the time evolution case: (b) we divided the outbreak into smaller, periodic intervals and looked at how MRSA spread over time. The MCqMC (Markov chain quasi Monte Carlo) method and artificial networks (whose main parameter is the number of contacts during a specific time interval) help us to understand real and simulated-paths of disease transition. Probability matrices (b) were used to find the mechanism of change states (vectors of all population, 0-susceptible or 1-infected).",10.1109/ENIC.2015.30,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7321250/,A.

4,IEEE:6513120,A ripple-spreading network model for the study of infectious disease transmission,"Mathematical analysis and modelling is central to infectious disease epidemiology. This paper, inspired by the natural ripple-spreading phenomenon, proposes a novel ripple-spreading network model for the study of infectious disease transmission. The new epidemic model naturally has good potential of capturing many spatial and temporal features observed in the outbreak of plagues. In particular, using a stochastic ripple-spreading process can well simulate the effect of random contacts and movements of individuals on the probability of infection, which is usually a challenging issue in epidemic modeling. Some ripple-spreading related parameters such as threshold and amplifying factor of nodes are ideal to describe the importance of individuals physical fitness and immunity. The new model is rich in parameters to incorporate many real factors such as public health service and polices, and it is highly flexible to modifications. Genetic algorithm is used to tune the parameters of the model by referring to historic data of an epidemic. The well tuned model can then be used for analyzing and forecasting purposes. The effectiveness of the propose method is illustrated by a preliminary study.",10.1109/BMEI.2012.6513120,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6513120/,J. Q. Liao; X. B. Hu; M. Wang; M. S. Leeson; E.

5,IEEE:8189212,Efficient parameter estimation for models of healthcare-associated pathogen transmission in discrete and continuous time,"We describe two novel Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches to computing estimates of parameters concerned with healthcare-associated infections. The first approach frames the discrete time, patient level, hospital transmission model as a Bayesian network, and exploits this framework to improve greatly on the computational efficiency of estimation compared with existing programs. The second approach is in continuous time and shares the same computational advantages. Both methods have been implemented in programs that are available from the authors. We use these programs to show that time discretization can lead to statistical bias in the underestimation of the rate of transmission of pathogens. We show that the continuous implementation has similar running time to the discrete implementation, has better Markov chain mixing properties, and eliminates the potential statistical bias. We, therefore, recommend its use when continuous-time data are available.",10.1093/imammb/dqt021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8189212/,A. Thomas; A. Redd; K. Khader; M. Leecaster; T.

6,IEEE:9090302,Predicting COVID-19 in China Using Hybrid AI Model,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) breaking out in late December 2019 is gradually being controlled in China, but it is still spreading rapidly in many other countries and regions worldwide. It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public s prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.",10.1109/TCYB.2020.2990162,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9090302/,N.

7,IEEE:9089488,Virtual Reality Module Depicting Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection as Educational Tool to Reduce Antibiotic Resistant Hospital-Acquired Bacterial Infections,Virtual Reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are used as simulation models in student-patient interactive medical education and shown to enhance learning outcomes. The rise in global burden of infectious diseases accompanied with the significant rise in antibiotic resistance world-wide prompt immediate action to combat the emerging threat of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Urinary tract infections are common bacterial infections. Urinary catheters are commonly used in hospitalized patients and catheter associated urinary infections (CAUTI) are the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. The aim of this research is to develop a virtual reality (VR) based educational tool depicting the process of CAUTI caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. The VR-CAUTI module is designed to bring awareness and provide insights to health care providers and community which help in reducing the burden and spread of antibiotic resistant infections. VR based modules have the potential to transform and revolutionize learning experience and render medical education compatible with the IoT in the current 4th industrial revolution.,10.1109/ICIoT48696.2020.9089488,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9089488/,Y.

8,IEEE:8787471,Improving Interpretable Prediction Models for Antimicrobial Resistance,"One of the major problems of healthcare institutions is the treatment of infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobials. The early prediction of such infections can improve the patient s evolution as well as minimise the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The creation of effective prediction models is particularly limited due to the high dimensionality of data, the imbalanced datasets and the concept drift problem. In this paper, we face these challenges from a machine learning perspective, considering the interpretability of the resulting models as essential. In particular, we present a study of multiple techniques focused on the mitigation of these problems, that are used in combination with interpretable models. Our results indicate that the use of oversampling along with sliding windows can improve the resulting AUC of models (up to reaching a mean AUC of 0.80 in our dataset), and FCBF can be used to drastically reduce the number of predictors, obtaining simpler models with a slight AUC reduction (from a mean number of predictors of 69.78 to 16.28, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76). According to our results, we show that the combination of multiple techniques for dealing with the aforementioned data-mining problems can clearly improve the performance of prediction models for antimicrobial resistance.",10.1109/CBMS.2019.00111,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8787471/,B.

9,IEEE:8191427,Improved hidden Markov model for nosocomial infections,"We propose a novel hidden Markov model (HMM) for parameter estimation in hospital transmission models, and show that commonly made simplifying assumptions can lead to severe model misspecification and poor parameter estimates. A standard HMM that embodies two commonly made simplifying assumptions, namely a fixed patient count and binomially distributed detections is compared with a new alternative HMM that does not require these simplifying assumptions. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how each of the simplifying assumptions used by the standard model leads to model misspecification, whereas the alternative model results in accurate parameter estimates.",10.1093/imammb/dqt013,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8191427/,K.

10,IEEE:6698500,Image processing as the validation method of droplet dispersion modeling process,"A pandemic of respiratory viral infections, which was spreading throughout the world during the first decade of the 21st century are believed to be easily contagious via direct contact through droplets and aerosol containing an infected particle which is spreading near the patient s environment. From the previous research, the role of droplet spreading during the coughing and talking are already investigated. However, massive viral infectious outbreaks during the SARS pandemic treatment procedure in the hospital on 2003 revealed that there is also a greater risk of viral dissemination process during the treatment practice. This project is aimed to understand about the droplet spreading characteristic during the dissemination process and to develop modeling method to make a prediction mechanism of droplet motion through a simple simulation program. The modeling has derived from basic theory of air viscosity, verified with droplet mist flow pattern images which are obtained through a digital image processing method. The results show that droplet modeling simulation which is based on the air viscosity factor gives an improved result to mimicking the droplet flow pattern, particularly during the operation of nebulizer. It also concluded that the droplet would perfectly evaporate as it travels more than 5 centimeters from the launch point and remain airborne during the treatment procedure.",10.1109/ICICI-BME.2013.6698500,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6698500/,N.

11,IEEE:5678923,A dynamic patient network model of hospital-acquired infections,"We investigate the transmission of infectious diseases in hospitals using a network-centric perspective. Patients who share a health care worker (HCW) are inherently connected to each other and those connections form a network through which transmission can occur. The structure of such networks can be a strong determinant of the extent and rate of transmission. We first examine how the density of the patient network affects transmission. Our experiments demonstrate that nurses are responsible for spreading more infection because they typically visit patients more often. However, doctors also pose a serious threat because their patient networks are more highly connected, which creates more opportunity for transmission to spread to multiple cohorts in the unit. We also explore the effects of patient sharing among HCWs, which temporarily alters the structure of the patient network. Our results suggest that this practice should be done in a structured manner to minimize additional transmission.",10.1109/WSC.2010.5678923,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5678923/,S. Barnes; B.

12,IEEE:9073164,Evaluating Architectural Changes to Alter Pathogen Dynamics in a Dialysis Unit,"This paper presents a high-fidelity agent-based simulation of the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a serious hospital acquired infection, within the dialysis unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC). The simulation is based on ten days of fine-grained healthcare worker (HCW) movement and interaction data collected from a sensor mote instrumentation of the dialysis unit by our research group in the fall of 2013. The simulation layers a detailed model of MRSA pathogen transfer, die-off, shedding, and infection on top of agent interactions obtained from data. The specific question this paper focuses on is whether there are simple, inexpensive architectural or process changes one can make in the dialysis unit to reduce the spread of MRSA? We evaluate two architectural changes of the nurses station: (i) splitting the central nurses station into two smaller distinct nurses stations, and (ii) doubling the surface area of the nursing station. The first architectural change is modeled as a graph partitioning problem on a HCW contact network obtained from our HCW movement data. Somewhat counter-intuitively, our results suggest that the first architectural modification and the resulting reduction in HCW-HCW contacts has little to noeffect on the spread of MRSA and may in fact lead to an increase in MRSA infection counts in some cases. In contrast, the second modification leads to a substantial reduction - between 12% and 22% for simulations with different parameters - in the number of patients infected by MRSA. These results suggest that the dynamics of an environmentally mediated infection such as MRSA may be quite different from that of infections whose spread is not substantially affected by the environment (e.g., respiratory infections or influenza).",10.1145/3341161.3343515,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9073164/,H.

14,IEEE:9253381,Proxemic Interactions in Mobile Devices to Avoid the Spreading of Infections,"Currently, people s daily lives are affected by the pandemic produced by the COVID-19. One of the main problem is the quickly and easy spreading of the virus. Healthcare workers are affected by nosocomial infections (also called as hospital-acquired infections) that exist in workplaces and more specifically, from health care equipment. In practice, the use of technology is quite common in health care settings. However, due to the touchability of mobile digital devices, their use contributes to nosocomial infections, according to several studies. Some applications based on tracking people have been implemented in order to facilitate Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and preventing contamination of surfaces by people s hands. Notwithstanding, their use still presents limitations related to implementing applications to be used in some hospital environments, such as care rooms, laboratories, clinical workrooms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the use of interpersonal distances and proxemic dimensions (i.e., Distance, Identity, Location, Movement, and orientation- DILMO) for implementing HCI with mobile devices that reduces their touchability. The aim is to facilitate the development of mobile apps with proxemic HCI, supported in a proposed architecture, to stop spreading of nosocomial infection of COVID-19 and others. To show the usability and suitability of our proposal, we present two prototypes of apps for mobile devices as proof-of concept, using several combination of proxemic DILMO dimensions to model proxemic HCI that allow flexibility in interpersonal and devices people interactions.",10.1109/WiMob50308.2020.9253381,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9253381/,P.

16,IEEE:9181512,Anonymity Preserving IoT-Based COVID-19 and Other Infectious Disease Contact Tracing Model,"Automated digital contact tracing is effective and efficient, and one of the non-pharmaceutical complementary approaches to mitigate and manage epidemics like Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite the advantages of digital contact tracing, it is not widely used in the western world, including the US and Europe, due to strict privacy regulations and patient rights. We categorized the current approaches for contact tracing, namely: mobile service-provider-application, mobile network operators call detail, citizen-application, and IoT-based. Current measures for infection control and tracing do not include animals and moving objects like cars despite evidence that these moving objects can be infection carriers. In this article, we designed and presented a novel privacy anonymous IoT model. We presented an RFID proof-of-concept for this model. Our model leverages blockchain s trust-oriented decentralization for on-chain data logging and retrieval. Our model solution will allow moving objects to receive or send notifications when they are close to a flagged, probable, or confirmed diseased case, or flagged place or object. We implemented and presented three prototype blockchain smart contracts for our model. We then simulated contract deployments and execution of functions. We presented the cost differentials. Our simulation results show less than one-second deployment and call time for smart contracts, though, in real life, it can be up to 25 seconds on Ethereum public blockchain. Our simulation results also show that it costs an average of $1.95 to deploy our prototype smart contracts, and an average of $0.34 to call our functions. Our model will make it easy to identify clusters of infection contacts and help deliver a notification for mass isolation while preserving individual privacy. Furthermore, it can be used to understand better human connectivity, model similar other infection spread network, and develop public policies to control the spread of COVID-19 while preparing for future epidemics.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3020513,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9181512/,L.

17,IEEE:7844765,Infectious hospital agents: An individual-based simulation framework,"In this paper we present the plan, motivation, background, and the design of an agent-based simulation framework describing the spread of Hospital-Associated Infections (HAIs). We are developing a general simulation environment that is able to model wide range of pathogen transmission scenarios in hospital environment. The elements of the simulation include among others: admission and discharge patients, pathogen transmission via healthcare workers, colonization and infection, modelling hospital events, scheduling treatments, the interventions against HAI spreading.

18,IEEE:7738429,Exploiting Social Network to Enhance Human-to-Human Infection Analysis without Privacy Leakage,"Human-to-human infection, as a type of fatal public health threats, can rapidly spread, resulting in a large amount of labor and health cost for treatment, control and prevention. To slow down the spread of infection, social network is envisioned to provide detailed contact statistics to isolate susceptive people who has frequent contacts with infected patients. In this paper, we propose a novel human-to-human infection analysis approach by exploiting social network data and health data that are collected by social network and e-healthcare technologies. We enable the social cloud server and health cloud server to exchange social contact information of infected patients and user s health condition in a privacy-preserving way. Specifically, we propose a privacy-preserving data query method based on conditional oblivious transfer to guarantee that only the authorized entities can query users social data and the social cloud server cannot infer anything during the query. In addition, we propose a privacy-preserving classification-based infection analysis method that can be performed by untrusted cloud servers without accessing the users health data. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed approach achieves higher infection analysis accuracy with the acceptable computational overhead.",10.1109/TDSC.2016.2626288,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7738429/,K.

19,IEEE:8910253,Effects of photodynamic therapy on materials used in hospitals,"In the hospital environment, the disinfection and sterilization of medical devices are essential, and the development of efficient techniques with low cost and absence of collateral effects is still necessary. The photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a successful technique for treating infections caused by different microorganisms, but nothing is reported about the effects of PDT on materials often employed in hospitals. In this way, this in vitro study aimed to verify the actions of PDT on polypropylene, aluminum and Aisi 304 steel taking into account the following aspects: cytotoxicity, mechanical properties and effects on bacterial biofilms. For that, this study was splitted into three experimental phases. In the first one, 27 samples of each proposed material (polypropylene, aluminum and Aisi 304 steel) were prepared and randomly distributed in 27 experimental groups (n = 3) for treatment with autoclave (121 °C for 30 min) or PDT (λ = 660nm, 100 mW, 60 J, 111 mW/cm2, 66.66 J/cm 2, for 10 minutes) with different repetitions of the treatments (samples treated with 1, 4, 28 and 120 repetitions). After that, it was performed a cytotoxicity test using Vero fibroblasts. In the second experimental phase, 90 samples of each material were prepared, which were randomly distributed in the same previously described 27 experimental groups (n = 10). After the treatments, samples were submitted to tensile strength test. In the third experimental phase, biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus were prepared and then treated with PDT. The data were statistically analyzed at a significance level of 5%. The Vero cells showed similar adhesion, spreading and growth in both experimental groups, and the cytochemical analysis showed no changes in cellular activity in any of the experimental groups. Autoclave sterilization increased the elastic modulus of Aisi 304 steel and polypropylene and reduced it in aluminum after 120 repetitions. PDT increased the elastic modulus of steel, aluminum and polypropylene. PDT significantly reduced the biofilm of Staphylococcus aureus formed on the materials. It was possible to conclude that PDT is a promising alternative technique for decontamination of materials and, although it alters some mechanical properties, PDT seems to be a good technique for future use in hospitals.",10.1109/SBFoton-IOPC.2019.8910253,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8910253/,K.

20,IEEE:6944917,A mathematical model of bipolar radiofrequency-induced thermofusion,"Bipolar radiofrequency-induced thermofusion has become a widely accepted method successfully used in open and particularly in minimally-invasive surgery for the sealing of blood vessels and tissue of up to several millimeters diameter. Despite its wide-spread application, the thermofusion process itself is not well understood on a quantitative and dynamic level, and manufacturers largely rely on trial-and-error methods to improve existing instruments. To predict the effect of alternative generator control strategies and to allow for a more systematic approach to improve thermofusion instruments, a mathematical model of the thermofusion process is developed. The system equations describe the spatial and temporal evolution of the tissue temperature due to Joule heating and heat transfer, and the loss of tissue water due to vaporization. The resulting effects on the tissue properties, most importantly the electrical resistivity, heat capacity and thermal conductivity, are considered as well. Experimental results indicate that the extent of the lateral thermal damage is directly affected by Joule heating of the lateral tissue. The experimental findings are supported by simulation results using the proposed mathematical model of thermofusion.",10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944917,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6944917/,J.

21,IEEE:7763193,Infection tracing in smart hospitals,"Many disease infection cases are acquired and spread in hospital settings. Early detection of such infection cases is necessary to identify population at risk accurately and effectively. This paper introduces a systematic infection detection framework utilizing mobile communication technologies including mobile networking and encounter statistics during infection breakouts. Our target environment is smart connected hospitals using Internet of things. First, the disease infection trace-back problem is defined. Then a detailed practical framework is devised using wireless encounters to facilitate the trace-back to the infection source and identify the population at risk; the nodes that are likely infected. Trace back and filtering methods are then proposed using probabilistic forward and backward search techniques. We use extensive WLAN campus traces of six buildings with different mobility characteristics and over 34K users to drive our simulations. Metrics of true positive, true negative, accuracy and coverage are measured and presented. Our results thus far show promise, where in most cases the accuracy of correctly selecting the infected nodes that have been in the area during the epidemic period were found to reach 70-80% with population selection coverage close to the infection percentage of nodes.",10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763193,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7763193/,M.

22,IEEE:9095328,Dual-Sampling Attention Network for Diagnosis of COVID-19 From Community Acquired Pneumonia,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world, and has infected more than 1,436,000 people in more than 200 countries and territories as of April 9, 2020. Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to automatically diagnose COVID-19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a 5-fold cross-validation. In the testing stage, we employ another independent large-scale testing dataset including 2796 CT scans from 2057 patients. Results show that our algorithm can identify the COVID-19 images with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.944, accuracy of 87.5%, sensitivity of 86.9%, specificity of 90.1%, and F1-score of 82.0%. With this performance, the proposed algorithm could potentially aid radiologists with COVID-19 diagnosis from CAP, especially in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.",10.1109/TMI.2020.2995508,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9095328/,X.

In this paper, by combining a designed memristive synapse and a resistive synapse, a novel neural network circuit with three neurons and one operational module has been constructed. With the memristor device whose resistance can be purposely changed according to the time interval between pre- and post-spikes, the weight of the memristive synapse that connected between two neurons can be modified as required.

24,IEEE:5738699,Wireless Sensor Networks for Monitoring Physiological Signals of Multiple Patients,"This paper presents the design of a novel wireless sensor network structure to monitor patients with chronic diseases in their own homes through a remote monitoring system of physiological signals. Currently, most of the monitoring systems send patients data to a hospital with the aid of personal computers (PC) located in the patients home. Here, we present a new design which eliminates the need for a PC. The proposed remote monitoring system is a wireless sensor network with the nodes of the network installed in the patients homes. These nodes are then connected to a central node located at a hospital through an Internet connection. The nodes of the proposed wireless sensor network are created by using a combination of ECG sensors, MSP430 microcontrollers, a CC2500 low-power wireless radio, and a network protocol called the SimpliciTI protocol. ECG signals are first sampled by a small portable device which each patient carries. The captured signals are then wirelessly transmitted to an access point located within the patients home. This connectivity is based on wireless data transmission at 2.4-GHz frequency. The access point is also a small box attached to the Internet through a home asynchronous digital subscriber line router. Afterwards, the data are sent to the hospital via the Internet in real time for analysis and/or storage. The benefits of this remote monitoring are wide ranging: the patients can continue their normal lives, they do not need a PC all of the time, their risk of infection is reduced, costs significantly decrease for the hospital, and clinicians can check data in a short time.",10.1109/TBCAS.2011.2114661,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5738699/,R.

This pandemic also exposed the loopholes in the systems for few `Developed Nations , `Established Public Health Systems , and `Billion Dollar Forex Reserves that most of the countries relied upon in general. All these were challenged to the core once the COVID-19 pandemic started growing exponentially from March 2020 forcing the countries to go under lockdown which has curved down their economic charts. Malaysia too has suffered with a months-long lockdown, growing unemployment and shrinking economy. The SMEs in Malaysia are among the worst affected. In May 2020, almost 50% of the SMEs reached a position where their very existence was at stake. A potential second or third wave of COVID-19 or some other pandemic in future is not any surprise for Malaysia. But, how far the country and its SMEs are prepared to face such situation again is the question. A quick and accurate data analytics on historical pandemics, hospital data, infection rates, tracking, testing and treatments offered may help in predicting the primary signs that can protect from disasters to a great extent. This study applies `technology acceptance model to Malaysian SMEs to explore the possibility of Data Science in launching accurate forecasts that could keep them in a better position rather than getting caught in surprise lockdowns.

We iteratively applied a full 2k factorial design on the output of a stochastic, agent-based simulation to compare the effects of the hand hygiene compliance of healthcare workers and the nurse-to-patient ratio on the transmission of MRSA in a 20-bed ICU. The results suggest that increasing the nurse-to-patient ratio is more effective at levels below approximately 60% compliance of nurses.

Africa, Zika and current SARS-CoV-2 underscore the critical importance of emergency response and medical preparedness. Such needs are wide-spread as globalization and air transportation facilitate rapid disease spread across the world. Computational modeling of infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics offer insights in propagation patterns and facilitate policy makers to synthesize potential interventions. Current models include inclined decay with an exponential adjustment, SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) compartmental model, discrete time stochastic processes, and transmission tree. While many of these models incorporate contact tracing to predict spread pattern, key elements on optimal usage of scarce resources and effective and efficient process performance (e.g., diagnostics and screening, non-pharmaceutical interventions, trained personnel/robots for treatment, decontamination) have not been included. This is particularly critical in the fight of COVID-19 containment due to lack of testing kits and the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission, and the long period of hospitalization required by severely sick patients.This work focuses on designing a system computational decision modeling framework that simultaneously i) captures disease spread characteristics, ii) incorporates day-to-day hospital and home care processes and resource usage, iii) explores non-pharmaceutical intervention, social and human behavior and iv) allows for system optimization to minimize infection and mortality under time and labor constraints.",10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313325,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9313325/,E.

32,IEEE:6347012,A network analysis of the dynamics of seizure,"Seizures are events that spread through the brain s network of connections and create pathological activity. To understand what is occurring in the brain during seizure we investigated the time progression of the brain s state from seizure onset to seizure suppression. Knowledge of a seizure s dynamics and the associated spatial structure is important for localizing the seizure foci and determining the optimal location and timing of electrical stimulation to mitigate seizure development. In this study, we analyzed intracranial EEG data recorded in 2 human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy prior to undergoing resection surgery using network analyses. Specifically, we computed a time sequence of connectivity matrices from iEEG (intracranial electroencephalography) recordings that represent network structure over time. For each patient, connectivity between electrodes was measured using the coherence in the band of frequencies with the strongest modulation during seizure. The connectivity matrices structure was analyzed using an eigen-decomposition. The leading eigenvector was used to estimate each electrode s time dependent centrality (importance to the network s connectivity).

33,IEEE:6944700,Design an easy-to-use infection screening system for non-contact monitoring of vital-signs to prevent the spread of pandemic diseases,"The outbreak of infectious diseases such as influenza, dengue fever, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are threatening the global health. Especially, developing countries in the South-East Asia region have been at serious risk. Rapid and highly reliable screening of infection is urgently needed during the epidemic season at mass gathering places, such as airport quarantine facilities, public health centers, and hospital outpatients units, etc. To meet this need, our research group is currently developing a multiple vital-signs based infection screening system that can perform human medical inspections within 15 seconds. This system remotely monitors facial temperature, heart and respiration rates using a thermopile array and a 24-GHz microwave radar, respectively. In this work, we redesigned our previous system to make a higher performance with a user-friendly interface. Moreover, the system newly included a multivariable logistic regression model (MLRM) to determine the possibility of infection. We tested the system on 34 seasonal influenza patients and 35 normal control subjects at the Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the screening system using the MLRM were 85.3% and 88.6%, respectively.",10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944700,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6944700/,G. Sun; N. Q.

34,IEEE:9172136,Efficient and Effective Training of COVID-19 Classification Networks With Self-Supervised Dual-Track Learning to Rank,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide since first reported. Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial both for disease control and patient care. Non-contrast thoracic computed tomography (CT) has been identified as an effective tool for the diagnosis, yet the disease outbreak has placed tremendous pressure on radiologists for reading the exams and may potentially lead to fatigue-related mis-diagnosis. Reliable automatic classification algorithms can be really helpful; however, they usually require a considerable number of COVID-19 cases for training, which is difficult to acquire in a timely manner. Meanwhile, how to effectively utilize the existing archive of non-COVID-19 data (the negative samples) in the presence of severe class imbalance is another challenge. In addition, the sudden disease outbreak necessitates fast algorithm development. In this work, we propose a novel approach for effective and efficient training of COVID-19 classification networks using a small number of COVID-19 CT exams and an archive of negative samples. Concretely, a novel self-supervised learning method is proposed to extract features from the COVID-19 and negative samples. Then, two kinds of soft-labels (`difficulty and `diversity ) are generated for the negative samples by computing the earth mover s distances between the features of the negative and COVID-19 samples, from which data `values of the negative samples can be assessed. A pre-set number of negative samples are selected accordingly and fed to the neural network for training. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve superior performance using about half of the negative samples, substantially reducing model training time.",10.1109/JBHI.2020.3018181,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172136/,Y.

The current gold standard test, CLAMP, is too labor intensive to be used in general practice. A recently developed dynamic insulin sensitivity test, DIST, uses a glucose-insulin-C-peptide model to calculate model-based insulin sensitivity, SI. Preliminary results show good correlation to CLAMP. However both CLAMP and DIST ignore saturation in insulin-mediated glucose removal. This study uses the data from 17 patients who underwent multiple DISTs to investigate interstitial insulin action and its influence on modeled insulin sensitivity. The critical parameters influencing interstitial insulin action are saturation in insulin receptor binding, αG, and plasma-interstitial diffusion rate, nI. Very low values of αG and very low values of nI produced the most intra-patient variability in SI. Repeatability in SI is enhanced with modeled insulin receptor saturation. Future parameter study on subjects with varying degree of insulin resistance may provide a better understanding of different contributing factors of insulin resistance.",10.1049/ic.2010.0358,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6490816/,J.

However, at the present time, no Transcutaneous Energy Transfer (TET) system is commercially available and ready for long-term use. Specifically the heating of the tissue due to power losses in the TET coils is a major problem. The focus of this paper therefore is on the minimization of the power losses in the energy transmission and receiver coils of a TET system. Extensive parameter sweeps were performed in order to find the optimal winding configuration with minimized parasitic resistances and optimal inductance value. A thermal model of the human skin is developed to estimate the thermal limits. Based on the results, a prototype TET system is built to validate the optimization process. The prototype system is capable of transmitting 30W of power with an efficiency greater than 93 %, even at a coil separation distance of 20mm (0.79 in) and 70mm (2.76 in) coil diameter.",10.1109/COMPEL.2014.6877190,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6877190/,O.

For such a large-scale pandemic, early detection and isolation of potential virus carriers is essential to curb the spread of the pandemic. Recent studies have shown that one important feature of COVID-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by viral infections. During the pandemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce the risk of getting sick. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a portable non-contact method to screen the health conditions of people wearing masks through analysis of the respiratory characteristics from RGB-infrared sensors. We first accomplish a respiratory data capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a bidirectional GRU neural network with an attention mechanism is applied to the respiratory data to obtain the health screening result. The results of validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status of respiratory with 83.69% accuracy, 90.23% sensitivity and 76.31% specificity on the real-world dataset. This work demonstrates that the proposed RGB-infrared sensors on portable device can be used as a pre-scan method for respiratory infections, which provides a theoretical basis to encourage controlled clinical trials and thus helps fight the current COVID-19 pandemic.

They may be asymptomatic or may give rise to undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The number of dengue cases at Jember reported increased from 77 in 2011 to 923 in 2015 and case fatality rate exceeded 1.3 in 2011 and over 1.6 in 2015. The main obstacles of dengue surveillance are occurred due to lack of public response to the onset of dengue viral infections cases in the surrounding environment, reporting cases from the hospitals, clinics, or community health centre have been delayed because of accessibility factor and manual written report. Without the validity of the information from dengue patient data, epidemiological investigation can t provide valuable information to control ongoing outbreaks. To overcome these problems, the development of prevention information system of dengue viral infections plays crucial role in the identifying cases and obtaining information from them to decide what actions must be taken by Health Department of Jember to control and eliminate outbreaks. To build robust prevention information system is used the hybrid model to combine both Waterfall and Agile. Leveraging both the Waterfall and Agile approach ensures the success of the project. It removes the disadvantages of both the models while bringing together the advantages of both.

Lack of hand hygiene is one of the major reasons for healthcare associated infections (HAIs) in hospitals. Adherence to hand hygiene compliance by the workers in the food business is very important for preventing food-borne illness. In addition to healthcare settings and food businesses, hand washing is also vital for personal well-being. Despite the importance of hand hygiene, people often do not wash hands when necessary. Automatic detection of hand washing activity can facilitate just-in-time alerts when a person forgets to wash hands. Monitoring hand washing practices is also essential in ensuring accountability and providing personalized feedback, particularly in hospitals and food businesses. Inertial sensors available in smart wrist devices can capture hand movements, and so it is feasible to detect hand washing using these devices. However, it is challenging to detect hand washing using wrist wearable sensors since hand movements are associated with a wide range of activities. In this paper, we present HAWAD, a robust solution for hand washing detection using wrist wearable inertial sensors. We leverage the distribution of penultimate layer output of a neural network to detect hand washing from a wide range of activities.

The main goal of this computational algorithm is to reduce the spread of the virus and decrease the number of infected people. To do so, health care routes are generated according to the priority of certain population groups. The algorithm was applied to New York state data. Based on infection rates and reported deaths, hot spots were determined by applying the kernel density estimation (KDE) to the groups that have been previously obtained using a clustering algorithm together with the elbow method. For each cluster, the survival rate - the key information to prioritize medical care - was determined using the proportional hazards model. Finally, ant colony optimization (ACO) and the traveling salesman problem (TSP) optimization algorithms were applied to identify the optimal route to the closest hospital. The results obtained efficiently covered the points with the highest concentration of COVID-19 cases.

44,IEEE:6490886,Prediction of cardiac output changes with response to PEEP on patients under mechanical ventilation,"The application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) decreases cardiac output (CO). Accurate measurement of CO is invasive and is not ideal for all MV critically ill patients. However, the link between the PEEP used in MV, and CO provides an opportunity to assess CO via MV therapy and other existing measurements, creating a non-invasive CO measure. This paper examines combining models of diffusion resistance with lung mechanics, to help predict CO changes due to PEEP. The CO estimator uses an initial measurement of pulmonary shunt, and estimations of shunt changes due to PEEP to predict CO at different levels of PEEP. Inputs to the cardiac model are the PV loops from the ventilator, as well as the oxygen saturation values using known respiratory inspired oxygen content. The output is estimates of pulmonary shunt and CO changes due to changes in applied PEEP. Data from two published studies are used to assess and initially validate this model. The model shows the effect on oxygenation due to decreased CO and decreased shunt, resulting from increased PEEP. It concludes that there is a trade off on oxygenation parameters. More clinically importantly, the model also looks at how the rate of CO drop with increased PEEP may also be used as a method to determine optimal PEEP, and optimise MV therapy with respect to the gas exchange achieved, while also accounting for its impact on cardiovascular system management.",10.1049/ic.2010.0428,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6490886/,A.

Once a seizure is predicted/detected by the system, electrical stimulation is delivered to prevent seizure initiation or spread. So far, seizure prediction/detection has been limited to tracking non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) or intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals. Here, we examine seizure prediction based on local field potentials (LFPs) from a small neocortical patch recorded via a 10×10 microelectrode array implanted in a patient with focal seizures. We formulate the seizure (ictal) prediction problem in terms of discriminating between interictal and preictal neural activity. Using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we show that periods of preictal activity can be successfully discriminated (80% detection; no false positives) from periods of interictal activity several (2-18) minutes prior to seizure onset. CNN input features consisted of the spectral power of LFP channels (1-second time windows) computed in 50 frequency bands (0-100 Hz; 2 Hz steps).

47,IEEE:5718490,Leveraging Social Network Analysis to Improve the Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices and Systems in Healthcare,"In healthcare, evidence-based practice (EBP) integrates clinical expertise with the best available external evidence from systematic research. Yet even with the aid of technology, implementation of EBP in many settings remains a challenge. This paper combines research from the fields of healthcare implementation science and social networks to present an integrated framework for the study of EBP-related information systems. We explore the application of the framework to a complex healthcare collaborative, the MRSA infection control project, a project intended to foster the implementation of EBP s to reduce the spread of MRSA infections.

However, the platform for angiogenesis inhibitors have not been proposed. In this study, we have developed a microfluidic device for generation of multi gradients to stimuli cancer-induced angiogenesis and fibroblast-induced angiogenesis simultaneously. The device features an interaction chamber, connected to the surrounding channels with radian shaped low-height structures used to locate clusters of cells. The formation of multiple gradients is achieved in the interaction chamber through diffusion and sustained by continuous perfusion. Microfluidic valve was developed to control the direction of flow for trapping cells of different types respectively. We show that our device could generate multiple concentration gradient and trap clusters of cells. These results demonstrated that our device is able to stimuli the angiogenesis and can be used to do the angiogenesis inhibitor study.",10.1109/TRANSDUCERS.2015.7180936,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7180936/,C.

49,IEEE:7545953,Ensemble-Based Methodology for the Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions,"Antibacterial resistance has been progressively increasing mostly due to selective antibiotic pressure, forcing pathogens to either adapt or die. The development of antibacterial resistance to last-line antibiotics urges the formulation of alternative strategies for drug discovery. Recently, attention has been devoted to the development of computational methods to predict drug-target interactions (DTIs). Here we present a computational strategy to predict proteome-scale DTIs based on the combination of the drugs chemical features and substructural fingerprints, and on the structural information and physicochemical properties of the proteins. We propose an ensemble learning combination of Support-Vector Machine and Random Forest to deal with the complexity of DTI classification. Two distinct classification models were developed to ascertain whether taking the type of protein target (i.e., enzymes, g-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels and nuclear receptors) into account improves classification performance. External validation analysis was consistent with internal five-fold cross-validation, with an AUC of 0.87. This strategy was applied to the proteome of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus COL (MRSA COL, taxonomy id: 93062), a major nosocomial pathogen worldwide whose antimicrobial resistance and incidence rate keeps steadily increasing.

In the present model, the average time to isolation (i.e. hospitalization) of infectious population is the main time-dependent parameter that defines the spread of infection. All the preventive measures aim to decrease the average time to isolation under given constraints.

51,IEEE:9086482,Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) With Structured Latent Multi-View Representation Learning,"Recently, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world. Due to the large number of infected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting high-dimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.",10.1109/TMI.2020.2992546,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9086482/,H.

52,IEEE:6834763,Power Loss Analysis and Comparison of Segmented and Unsegmented Energy Coupling Coils for Wireless Energy Transfer,"This paper investigated the power losses of unsegmented and segmented energy coupling coils for wireless energy transfer. Four 30-cm energy coupling coils with different winding separations, conductor cross-sectional areas, and number of turns were developed. The four coils were tested in both unsegmented and segmented configurations. The winding conduction and intrawinding dielectric losses of the coils were evaluated individually based on a well-established lumped circuit model. We found that the intrawinding dielectric loss can be as much as seven times higher than the winding conduction loss at 6.78 MHz when the unsegmented coil is tightly wound. The dielectric loss of an unsegmented coil can be reduced by increasing the winding separation or reducing the number of turns, but the power transfer capability is reduced because of the reduced magnetomotive force. Coil segmentation using resonant capacitors has recently been proposed to significantly reduce the operating voltage of a coil to a safe level in wireless energy transfer for medical implants. Here, we found that it can naturally eliminate the dielectric loss. The coil segmentation method and the power loss analysis used in this paper could be applied to the transmitting, receiving, and resonant coils in two- and four-coil energy transfer systems.",10.1109/JESTPE.2014.2330951,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6834763/,S.

57,IEEE:9099423,Wireless Powering of Next-Generation Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) Without Percutaneous Cable Driveline,"This article deals with the design of a wireless powering system for a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The modern LVAD is mainly a miniaturized blood pump attached to the heart and is driven by an electric motor powered by a cable driveline that exits the patient s body through the skin to be connected with an external battery. The driveline is a portal to the exterior environment and this can cause frequent and severe infections. The goal of this article is the elimination of the cable link between the interior and the exterior of the human body. To this aim, an innovative powering design of the LVAD is proposed adopting the wireless power transfer (WPT) technology based on magnetic resonant coupling. The main challenges in the design of a WPT system for LVAD application are the considerable implantation depth (5-10 cm) and the relatively high power (≈5 W) required by the device to operate continuously. Two different design solutions are proposed: 1) a subcutaneous receiving coil connected to the LVAD by a short driveline completely inside the human body and 2) an LVAD with a receiving circuit and coil, both integrated on it.",10.1109/TMTT.2020.2992462,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9099423/,T.

Contact operation is an important transmission route for nosocomial infection. Reducing direct contact during medical treatment can reduce nosocomial infection quickly and effectively. Scientific and technological progress in the 5G era brings new solutions to the problem of iatrogenic contamination.

60,IEEE:8621433,Exploration of multiclass and one-class learning methods for prediction of phage-bacteria interaction at strain level,"The emergence and rapid dissemination of antibiotic resistance threatens medical progress and calls for innovative approaches for the management of multidrug resistant infections. Phage-therapy, i.e., the use of viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria during their life cycle, is a re-emerging and promising alternative to solve this problem. The success of phage therapy mainly relies on the exact matching between both the target pathogenic bacteria and the therapeutic phage. Several papers propose models for in-silico prediction of phage-bacteria interactions but at the species level. In clinical applications prediction of phage-bacteria interaction at species level is not enough to target a given pathogenic bacteria strain.One of the main challenges to train classification models able to predict phage-bacteria interactions is the need of both types of samples: interaction and non-interaction phage-bacteria couples. Non-interactions are rarely reported, making these data scarce. This problem is even more evident for non-interaction data at strain level. These factors make difficult the use of classic machine learning algorithms which need relatively-balanced classes to produce accurate predictions.This problem calls for solutions to deal with such imbalanced data. In this paper are presented two approaches to tackle this problem. 1. To explore the use of One-Class learning methods 2.
