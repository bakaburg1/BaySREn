1,EM:L633990898,Effects of Mosquito Microbiota on the Survival Cost and Development Success of Avian Plasmodium,"Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect the capacity of mosquitoes for the transmission of vector-borne pathogens. Among them, mosquito microbiota may play a key role determining the development of pathogens in mosquitoes and the cost of infections. Here, we used a wild avian malaria-mosquito assemblage model to experimentally test the role of vector microbiota on the cost of infection and their consequences for parasite development. To do so, a cohort of Culex pipiens mosquitoes were treated with antibiotics, including gentamicin sulfate and penicillin-streptomycin, to alter their microbiota, and other cohort was treated with sterilized water as controls. Subsequently, both cohorts were allowed to feed on Plasmodium infected or uninfected house sparrows (Passer domesticus). The antibiotic treatment significantly increased the survival rate of mosquitoes fed on infected birds while this was not the case of mosquitoes fed on uninfected birds. Additionally, a higher prevalence of Plasmodium in the saliva of mosquitoes was found in antibiotic treated mosquitoes than in mosquitoes of the control group at 20 days post exposure (dpe). Analyses of the microbiota of a subsample of mosquitoes at 20 dpe suggest that although the microbiota diversity did not differ between individuals of the two treatments, microbiota in control mosquitoes had a higher number of unique features and enriched in biochemical pathways related to the immune system than antibiotic treated ones. In sum, this study provides support for the role of mosquito microbiota on mosquito survival and the presence of parasite DNA in their saliva.",10.3389/fmicb.2020.562220,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633990898,"Martínez-de la Puente, J ;Gutiérrez-López, R ;Díez-Fernández, A ;Soriguer, R C ;Moreno-Indias, I ;Figuerola, J ",Frontiers in Microbiology,Culex pipiens;ecology-diseases;malaria;microbiome;parasite transmission;vector-borne pathogens;virulence,gentamicin;streptomycin;unclassified drug;water;avian malaria;Culex pipiens;ecology;infectious agent;microbiome;parasite transmission;Passer domesticus;adult;antibiotic therapy;article;cohort analysis;controlled study;drug combination;drug therapy;female;human;immune system;male;mosquito control;nonhuman;parasite development;prevalence;saliva;survival rate,Article,13 Jan 2021,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
2,EM:L633980365,Identifying Transcriptomic Signatures and Rules for SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The world-wide Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was triggered by the widespread of a new strain of coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Multiple studies on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted immediately after the spread of the disease. However, the molecular pathogenesis of the virus and related diseases has still not been fully revealed. In this study, we attempted to identify new transcriptomic signatures as candidate diagnostic models for clinical testing or as therapeutic targets for vaccine design. Using the recently reported transcriptomics data of upper airway tissue with acute respiratory illnesses, we integrated multiple machine learning methods to identify effective qualitative biomarkers and quantitative rules for the distinction of SARS-CoV-2 infection from other infectious diseases. The transcriptomics data was first analyzed by Boruta so that important features were selected, which were further evaluated by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance method. A feature list was produced. This list was fed into the incremental feature selection, incorporating some classification algorithms, to extract qualitative biomarker genes and construct quantitative rules. Also, an efficient classifier was built to identify patients infected with SARS-COV-2. The findings reported in this study may help in revealing the potential pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 and finding new targets for vaccine design.",10.3389/fcell.2020.627302,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633980365,"Zhang, Y -H ;Li, H ;Zeng, T ;Chen, L ;Li, Z ;Huang, T ;Cai, Y -D ",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,classification rule;COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2;signature;transcriptomic,biological marker;vaccine;classification algorithm;coronavirus disease 2019;adult;article;classifier;communicable disease;controlled study;drug combination;feature selection;genetic marker;human;human tissue;quantitative analysis;respiratory tract disease;transcriptomics;upper respiratory tract,Article,11 Jan 2021,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
3,EM:L633950211,Characterization of Treponema pallidum Dissemination in C57BL/6 Mice,"The spirochetal pathogen Treponema pallidum causes 5 million new cases of venereal syphilis worldwide each year. One major obstacle to syphilis prevention and treatment is the lack of suitable experimental animal models to study its pathogenesis. Accordingly, in this study, we further evaluated the responses of mice to Treponema pallidum. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that Treponema pallidum could colonize the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and testicles of C57BL/6 mice, and the organism may be able to rapidly penetrate the blood-brain barrier in mice by 24 h after infection. In subsequent rabbit infectivity tests, we observed evident signs of the microorganism in the mouse lymph node suspension. After infection, bacterial loads were higher in the tissues than in the blood of C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, a significant Th1 immune response was recorded by cytokine assays. Flow cytometric analysis suggested an obvious increase in the proportion of CD3(+) T and CD4(+) T cells in the spleen cells in the infected mice. Thus, improving our understanding of the response of C57BL/6 mice for Treponema pallidum will help to comprehensive elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of this bacterium and lay the foundation for the development of a new research model of Treponema pallidum.",10.3389/fimmu.2020.577129,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633950211,"Lu, S ;Zheng, K ;Wang, J ;Xu, M ;Xie, Y ;Yuan, S ;Wang, C ;Wu, Y ",Frontiers in Immunology,bacterial dissemination;C57BL/6 mice;inflammation;quantitative polymerase chain reaction;Treponema pallidum,CD3 antigen ;Treponema pallidum;animal cell;animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;apoptosis;article;bacterial infection;bacterial load;blood brain barrier;CD4+ T lymphocyte;CD8+ T lymphocyte;cell infiltration;controlled study;corpus cavernosum;DNA extraction;enzyme linked immunosorbent assay;flow cytometry;gene amplification;globus pallidus;heart;histology;histopathology;hypersensitivity;immune response;immunophenotyping;inflammation;kidney;Leporidae;liver;lymph node;macrophage;male;microglia;mouse;New Zealand rabbit;nonhuman;orchitis;pathogen load;polymerase chain reaction;prevalence;quantitative analysis;real time polymerase chain reaction;seroconversion;spleen cell;suspension;syphilis;testis;tumor associated leukocyte,Article,8 Jan 2021,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
4,EM:L633950296,"Prevalence and Predictors of Antimicrobial Resistance Among Enterococcus spp. From Dogs Presented at a Veterinary Teaching Hospital, South Africa","Background: While surveillance of antimicrobial drug resistance is ongoing in human medicine in South Africa, there is no such activity being performed in veterinary medicine. As a result, there is a need to investigate antimicrobial resistance among enterococci isolated from dogs in South Africa to improve understanding of the status of antimicrobial drug resistance given its public and veterinary public health importance. This study investigated antimicrobial resistance and factors associated with resistance profiles of enterococci isolated from dogs presented for veterinary care at a veterinary teaching hospital in South Africa. Methods: In total 102 Enterococcus isolated between 2007 and 2011 by a bacteriology laboratory at a teaching hospital were included in this study. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined against a panel of 18 antimicrobials using the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion technique. Univariate analysis was used to assess simple associations between year, season, breed group, age group, sex, and specimen as covariates and extensive drug resistance (XDR) as the outcome. Variables that were significant in the univariate analysis at a generous p-value ≤ 0.2 were included in the multivariable logistic models to investigate predictors of XDR. Results: All the Enterococcus isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial. High proportions of isolates were resistant against lincomycin (93%), kanamycin (87%), orbifloxacin (85%), and aminogycoside-lincosamide (77%). Ninety three percent (93%), 35.3, and 8.8% of the isolates exhibited multi-drug, extensive-drug and pan-drug resistance, respectively. Only year was significantly (p = 0.019) associated with extensive-drug resistance. Conclusion: Given the zoonotic potential of Enterococcus spp., the high antimicrobial resistance and multi-drug resistance observed in this study are a public health concern from one health perspective. The identified resistance to various antimicrobials may be useful in guiding clinicians especially in resource scarce settings where it is not always possible to perform AST when making treatment decisions.",10.3389/fvets.2020.589439,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633950296,"Oguttu, J W ;Qekwana, D N ;Odoi, A ",Frontiers in Veterinary Science,antimicrobial resistance;canine;dogs;enterococci;Enterococcus species;extensive-drug resistance;multi-drug resistance;pan-drug resistance,kanamycin;lincomycin;lincosamide;orbifloxacin;dog;Enterococcus;extensive drug resistance;multidrug resistance;prevalence;South Africa;teaching hospital;veterinary medicine;animal experiment;article;aspartate aminotransferase level;bacteriology;breed;controlled study;disk diffusion;female;groups by age;male;nonhuman;public health;season;univariate analysis,Article,7 Jan 2021,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
5,EM:L633953329,"Stroke Admissions, Stroke Severity, and Treatment Rates in Urban and Rural Areas During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Many regions worldwide reported a decline of stroke admissions during the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It remains unclear whether urban and rural regions experienced similar declines and whether deviations from historical admission numbers were more pronounced among specific age, stroke severity or treatment groups. Methods: We used registry datasets from (a) nine acute stroke hospitals in Berlin, and (b) nine hospitals from a rural TeleNeurology network in Northeastern Germany for primary analysis of 3-week-rolling average of stroke/TIA admissions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared course of stroke admission numbers with regional cumulative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) infections. In secondary analyses, we used emergency department logs of the Berlin Charité University hospital to investigate changes in age, stroke severity, and thrombolysis/thrombectomy frequencies during the early regional Sars-CoV-2 spread (March and April 2020) and compared them with preceding years. Results: Compared to past years, stroke admissions decreased by 20% in urban and 20-25% in rural hospitals. Deviations from historical averages were observable starting in early March and peaked when numbers of regional Sars-CoV-2 infections were still low. At the same time, average admission stroke severity and proportions of moderate/severe strokes (NIHSS >5) were 20 and 20–40% higher, respectively. There were no relevant deviations observed in proportions of younger patients (<65 years), proportions of patients with thrombolysis, or number of thrombectomy procedures. Stroke admissions at Charité subsequently rebounded and reached near-normal levels after 4 weeks when the number of new Sars-CoV-2 infections started to decrease. Conclusions: During the early pandemic, deviations of stroke-related admissions from historical averages were observed in both urban and rural regions of Northeastern Germany and appear to have been mainly driven by avoidance of admissions of mildly affected stroke patients.",10.3389/fneur.2020.607193,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633953329,"Erdur, H ;Siegerink, B ;Leithner, C ;Franke, C ;Lorenz-Meyer, I ;Theen, S ;Angermaier, A ;Kinze, S ;Weber, J E ;Rohmann, J L ;Scheitz, J F ;Nolte, C H ;Endres, M ;Audebert, H J ",Frontiers in Neurology,COVID19;epidemiology;public health;SARS-CoV-2;stroke,cerebrovascular accident ;university hospital;virus transmission,Article,6 Jan 2021,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
6,EM:L633774941,Poor treatment outcomes of children on highly active antiretroviral therapy: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction While access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for children with HIV has expanded and the use of HAART has substantially reduced the morbidity and mortality of children due to HIV, poor treatment outcomes among children with HIV are still a major public health problem globally. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to quantify treatment outcomes among children with HIV. Methods and analysis Systematic searches will be conducted in three electronic databases (PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science) for recent studies published from 01 Jan 2000 up to 28 October 2020, without geographical restriction. The primary outcomes of the study will be poor treatment outcomes, which include death, treatment failure and loss to follow-up. We will include quantitative studies that report treatment outcomes among children under the age of 18 years with HIV. Studies will be excluded if they are case report, case series, conducted among adults only or do not provide data on treatment outcomes for children. Two researchers will screen the titles and abstracts of all citations identified in our search, then review the full text of the remaining papers to identify those that meet the inclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be used for quality assessment. A random-effects meta-analysis will be used to obtain pooled estimates of the proportion of poor treatment outcomes. The heterogeneity between studies will be checked visually by using forest plots and quantitatively measured by the index of heterogeneity (I2). Pooled estimates of poor treatment outcomes will be calculated with a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis will be conducted by study settings, treatment regimen, comorbidity (such as tuberculosis), study period and HIV type (HIV-1 and HIV-2). Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval will not be required for this study as it will be based on published papers. The final report of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040161,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633774941,"Atalell, K A ;Alene, K A ",BMJ Open,epidemiology;HIV & AIDS;infectious diseases,anti human immunodeficiency virus agent ;adult;child;comorbidity;follow up;human;meta analysis;Newcastle-Ottawa scale;quality assessment tool;quality control;quantitative study;review;systematic review;treatment failure;treatment outcome;tuberculosis;young adult,Review,29 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
7,EM:L633907130,Pooled Plasmid Sequencing Reveals the Relationship Between Mobile Genetic Elements and Antimicrobial Resistance Genes in Clinically Isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae,"Plasmids remain important microbial components mediating the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. To systematically explore the relationship between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), a novel strategy using single-molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing was developed. This approach was applied to pooled conjugative plasmids from clinically isolated multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae from a tertiary referral hospital over a 9-month period. The conjugative plasmid pool was obtained from transconjugants that acquired antimicrobial resistance after plasmid conjugation with 53 clinical isolates. The plasmid pool was then subjected to SMRT sequencing, and 82 assembled plasmid fragments were obtained. In total, 124 ARGs (responsible for resistance to β-lactam, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside, among others) and 317 MGEs [including transposons (Tns), insertion sequences (ISs), and integrons] were derived from these fragments. Most of these ARGs were linked to MGEs, allowing for the establishment of a relationship network between MGEs and/or ARGs that can be used to describe the dissemination of resistance by mobile elements. Key elements involved in resistance transposition were identified, including IS26, Tn3, IS903B, ISEcp1, and ISKpn19. As the most predominant IS in the network, a typical IS26-mediated multicopy composite transposition event was illustrated by tracing its flanking 8-bp target site duplications (TSDs). The landscape of the pooled plasmid sequences highlights the diversity and complexity of the relationship between MGEs and ARGs, underpinning the clinical value of dominant HGT profiles.",10.1016/j.gpb.2020.12.002,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633907130,"Jiang, Y ;Wang, Y ;Hua, X ;Qu, Y ;Peleg, A Y ;Yu, Y ","Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",Horizontal transfer profile;Insertion sequence;Plasmid;Single-molecule real time sequencing;Transconjugant,aminoglycoside;endogenous compound;beta-lactam resistance;conjugative plasmid;gene insertion sequence;integron;multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae;article;horizontal gene transfer;nonhuman;tertiary care center,Article in Press,29 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
8,EM:L2010520698,A dual-therapy approach for the treatment of biofilm-mediated Salmonella gallbladder carriage,"Asymptomatic carriage of Salmonella Typhi continues to facilitate the transmission of typhoid fever, resulting in 14 million new infections and 136,000 fatalities each year. Asymptomatic chronic carriage of S. Typhi is facilitated by the formation of biofilms on gallstones that protect the bacteria from environmental insults and immune system clearance. Here, we identified two unique small molecules capable of both inhibiting Salmonella biofilm growth and disrupting pre-formed biofilm structures without affecting bacterial viability. In a mouse model of chronic gallbladder Salmonella carriage, treatment with either compound reduced bacterial burden in the gallbladder by 1–2 logs resulting in bacterial dissemination to peripheral organs that was associated with increased mortality. Co-administration of either compound with ciprofloxacin not only enhanced compound efficacy in the gallbladder by a further 1–1.5 logs for a total of 3–4.5 log reduction, but also prevented bacterial dissemination to peripheral organs. These data suggest a dual-therapy approach targeting both biofilm and planktonic populations can be further developed as a safe and efficient treatment of biofilm-mediated chronic S. Typhi infections.",10.1371/journal.ppat.1009192,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L2010520698,"Sandala, J L ;Eichar, B W ;Kuo, L G ;Hahn, M M ;Basak, A K ;Huggins, W M ;Woolard, K ;Melander, C ;Gunn, J S ",PLoS Pathogens,NA,ciprofloxacin;biofilm;gallbladder tissue;Salmonella;article;bacterial clearance;bacterial load;bacterial viability;column chromatography;confocal microscopy;immune system;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;mass spectrometry;minimum inhibitory concentration;nonhuman;particle size;plankton;polymerization;proteomics;typhoid fever,Article,28 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
9,EM:L2010574838,"The COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan, China: Epidemiology and impact of interventions","In January 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak was detected in Sichuan Province of China. Six weeks later, the outbreak was successfully contained. The aim of this work is to characterize the epidemiology of the Sichuan outbreak and estimate the impact of interventions in limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We analyzed patient records for all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020. To estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers, we used a Bayesian framework. In addition, we estimate the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies. The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. We estimated R(0) at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6–3.7). The epidemic was self-sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by Sichuan authorities. Our findings indicate that, were the control measures be adopted four weeks later, the epidemic could have lasted 49 days longer (95% CI: 31–68 days), causing 9,216 more cases (95% CI: 1,317–25,545).",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008467,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L2010574838,"Liu, Q -H ;Bento, A I ;Yang, K ;Zhang, H ;Yang, X ;Merler, S ;Vespignani, A ;Lv, J ;Yu, H ;Zhang, W ;Zhou, T ;Ajelli, M ",PLoS Computational Biology,NA,coronavirus disease 2019 ;disease surveillance;adolescent;adult;age distribution;aged;article;basic reproduction number;child;China;control strategy;epidemic;female;human;intervention study;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;public health;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;trend study;virus transmission,Article,28 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
10,EM:L633884384,"Emergence and dissemination of three mild outbreaks of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with high-level resistance to azithromycin in Barcelona, 2016-18","BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) isolates with high-level azithromycin resistance (HL-AziR) have emerged worldwide in recent decades, threatening the sustainability of current dual-antimicrobial therapy. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize the first 16 NG isolates with HL-AziR in Barcelona between 2016 and 2018. METHODS: WGS was used to identify the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, to establish the MLST ST, NG multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) ST and NG sequence typing for antimicrobial resistance (NG-STAR) ST and to identify the clonal relatedness of the isolates with other closely related NG previously described in other countries based on a whole-genome SNP analysis approach. The sociodemographic characteristics of the patients included in the study were collected by comprehensive review of their medical records. RESULTS: Twelve out of 16 HL-AziR isolates belonged to the MLST ST7823/NG-MAST ST5309 genotype and 4 to MLST ST9363/NG-MAST ST3935. All presented the A2059G mutation in all four alleles of the 23S rRNA gene. MLST ST7823/NG-MAST ST5309 isolates were only identified in men who have sex with women and MLST ST9363/NG-MAST ST3935 were found in MSM. Phylogenomic analysis revealed the presence of three transmission clusters of three different NG strains independently associated with sexual behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the first appearance of three mild outbreaks of NG with HL-AziR in Spain. These results highlight the continuous capacity of NG to develop antimicrobial resistance and spread among sexual networks. The enhanced resolution of WGS provides valuable information for outbreak investigation, complementing the implementation of public health measures focused on the prevention and dissemination of MDR NG.",10.1093/jac/dkaa536,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633884384,"Salmerón, P ;Moreno-Mingorance, A ;Trejo, J ;Amado, R ;Viñado, B ;Cornejo-Sanchez, T ;Alberny, M ;Barbera, M J ;Arando, M ;Pumarola, T ;Hoyos-Mallecot, Y ;Serra-Pladevall, J ;González-López, J J ",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,NA,azithromycin;endogenous compound;RNA 23S;Neisseria gonorrhoeae;adult;antibiotic resistance;article;case report;clinical article;demography;female;gene frequency;genotype;human;male;medical record;men who have sex with men;nonhuman;public health;sexual behavior;single nucleotide polymorphism;Spain,Article in Press,26 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv

13,EM:L633865892,Pre-radiofrequency ablation MRI imaging features predict the local tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma,"ABSTRACT: To investigate whether MRI features could preoperatively predict local tumor progression (LTP) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as the first-line treatment and improve a novel predictive model through developing a nomogram including various conventional MRI parameters. 105 patients with HCCs who had received RFA were enrolled. All patients had undergone conventional MRI before RFA. Uni- and multivariable analyses for LTP were assessing using a Cox proportional hazards model. The developed MRI-based nomogram was further designed based on multivariable logistic analysis in our study and the usefulness of the developed model was validated according to calibration curves and the C-index. Rim enhancement (hazard ratio: 2.689, P = .044) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values (hazard ratio: 0.055, P = .038) were statistically significant independent predictors of LTP after RFA at multivariable analysis. The performance of the nomogram incorporating two MRI parameters (with a C-index of 0.782) was improved compared with that based on rim enhancement and ADC alone (with C-index values of 0.630 and 0.728, respectively). The calibration curve of the MRI-based nomogram showed good conformance between evaluation and observation at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 years after RFA. The preliminary predictive model based on MRI findings including rim enhancement and ADC value could be used preoperatively to estimate the risk of LTP of HCC after RFA as the first-line treatment.",10.1097/MD.0000000000023924,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633865892,"Hu, Z ;Yu, N ;Wang, H ;Li, S ;Yan, J ;Zhang, G ",Medicine,NA,diagnosis;liver cell carcinoma ;nomogram;procedures;radiofrequency ablation;adverse event;diagnostic imaging;female;human;liver;male;middle aged;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;pathology;preoperative care;prognosis;reproducibility;tumor recurrence,Article,24 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv

15,EM:L633760045,Assessment of Air Contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in Hospital Settings,"Importance: Controversy remains regarding the transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objective: To review current evidence on air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings and the factors associated with contamination, including viral load and particle size. Evidence Review: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically queried for original English-language articles detailing SARS-CoV-2 air contamination in hospital settings between January 1 and October 27, 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patients. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per meter cubed of air were pooled, and their distribution was described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per meter cubed were analyzed after categorization as less than 1 μm, from 1 to 4 μm, and greater than 4 μm. Findings: Among 2284 records identified, 24 cross-sectional observational studies were included in the review. Overall, 82 of 471 air samples (17.4%) from close patient environments were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a significantly higher positivity rate in intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 of 107 [25.2%] vs non-intensive care unit, 39 of 364 [10.7%]; P <.001). There was no difference according to the distance from patients (≤1 m, 3 of 118 [2.5%] vs >1-5 m, 13 of 236 [5.5%]; P =.22). The positivity rate was 5 of 21 air samples (23.8%) in toilets, 20 of 242 (8.3%) in clinical areas, 15 of 122 (12.3%) in staff areas, and 14 of 42 (33.3%) in public areas. A total of 81 viral cultures were performed across 5 studies, and 7 (8.6%) from 2 studies were positive, all from close patient environments. The median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.0 × 10(3)copies/m(3)(0.4 × 10(3)to 3.1 × 10(3)copies/m(3)) in clinical areas to 9.7 × 10(3)copies/m(3)(5.1 × 10(3)to 14.3 × 10(3)copies/m(3)) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. Protective equipment removal and patient rooms had high concentrations per titer of SARS-CoV-2 (varying from 0.9 × 10(3)to 40 × 10(3)copies/m(3)and 3.8 × 10(3)to 7.2 × 10(3)TCID50/m(3)), with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the region of particle size less than 1 μm; staff offices had peaks in the region of particle size greater than 4 μm. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review, the air close to and distant from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, few of these samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found in toilets and bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways suggest that these areas should be carefully considered.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33232,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633760045,"Birgand, G ;Peiffer-Smadja, N ;Fournier, S ;Kerneis, S ;Lescure, F -X ;Lucet, J -C ",JAMA Network Open,NA,virus RNA ;air pollution;coronavirus disease 2019;hospital;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;viral contamination;aerosol;air sampling;article;artificial ventilation;bath;human;infection risk;infectious dose;intensive care unit;medical staff;nonhuman;particle size;priority journal;protective equipment;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;systematic review;tissue culture;toilet;ventilator;virus culture;virus load,Article,23 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
16,EM:L633838902,Intracellular Porphyromonas gingivalis Promotes the Proliferation of Colorectal Cancer Cells via the MAPK/ERK Signaling Pathway,"Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a keystone pathogen in periodontitis. However, several clinical studies have revealed an enrichment of P. gingivalis in the stool samples and colorectal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether P. gingivalis can promote colorectal cancer progression in vitro. We established an acute infection model (24 h, multiplicity of infection =100) of P. gingivalis invasion of colorectal cancer cells to study the alterations induced by P. gingivalis in the proliferation and cell cycle of colorectal cancer cells. We observed that P. gingivalis can adhere and invade host cells a few hours after infection. Once invaded, P. gingivalis significantly promoted colorectal cancer cell proliferation, and the percentage of S phase cells was increased in the cell cycle assay. However, KDP136, a gingipain-deficient mutant of P. gingivalis 33277, showed a decreased ability to promote colorectal cancer cell proliferation, indicating that gingipain is associated with colorectal cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we extracted RNA from colorectal cancer cells for high-throughput sequencing analysis and reconfirmed the results by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The results suggested that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is significantly activated by P. gingivalis, while these changes were not observed for KDP136. In conclusion, P. gingivalis can invade cells and promote the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells by activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Gingipain is an essential virulence factor in this interaction.",10.3389/fcimb.2020.584798,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633838902,"Mu, W ;Jia, Y ;Chen, X ;Li, H ;Wang, Z ;Cheng, B ",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,cell cycle;cell proliferation;colorectal neoplasms;gingipain cysteine endopeptidases;Porphyromonas gingivalis,gingipain cysteine endopeptidase;glutaraldehyde;hemin;mammalian target of rapamycin;mitogen activated protein kinase;toll like receptor 2;triazole;virulence factor;cell proliferation;colorectal cancer;MAPK signaling;Porphyromonas gingivalis;apoptosis;article;bacterial strain;cancer growth;cell adhesion assay;cell cycle assay;cell invasion assay;cell viability assay;cell viability assay kit;colony formation;controlled study;electron microscope;flow cytometry;fluorescence microscope;H7650 Hitachi;human;human cell;immunofluorescence microscopy;microplate reader;nonhuman;protein expression;real time polymerase chain reaction;RNA extraction;spectrophotometer;transmission electron microscopy;upregulation;Western blotting,Article,23 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
17,EM:L633877311,Lyme Disease Pathogenesis,"Lyme disease Borrelia are obligately parasitic, tick- transmitted, invasive, persistent bacterial pathogens that cause disease in humans and non-reservoir vertebrates primarily through the induction of inflammation. During transmission from the infected tick, the bacteria undergo significant changes in gene expression, resulting in adaptation to the mammalian environment. The organisms multiply and spread locally and induce inflammatory responses that, in humans, result in clinical signs and symptoms. Borrelia virulence involves a multiplicity of mechanisms for dissemination and colonization of multiple tissues and evasion of host immune responses. Most of the tissue damage, which is seen in non-reservoir hosts, appears to result from host inflammatory reactions, despite the low numbers of bacteria in affected sites. This host response to the Lyme disease Borrelia can cause neurologic, cardiovascular, arthritic, and dermatologic manifestations during the disseminated and persistent stages of infection. The mechanisms by which a paucity of organisms (in comparison to many other infectious diseases) can cause varied and in some cases profound inflammation and symptoms remains mysterious but are the subjects of diverse ongoing investigations. In this review, we provide an overview of virulence mechanisms and determinants for which roles have been demonstrated in vivo, primarily in mouse models of infection.",10.21775/cimb.042.473,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633877311,"Coburn, J ;Garcia, B ;Hu, L T ;Jewett, M W ;Kraiczy, P ;Norris, S J ;Skare, J ",Current issues in molecular biology,NA,Borreliella;adult;animal experiment;animal model;article;communicable disease;controlled study;human;immune response;in vivo study;inflammation;male;mouse;mouse model;nonhuman;skin manifestation;tick;tissue injury,Article in Press,23 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
18,EM:L633879850,Preliminary experiences in acute occupational therapy for in-patients with coronavirus-19 (COVID-19): leveraging assistive technology in three case studies of male veterans,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019 with millions of cases reported globally in the succeeding months. Initial hospitalisation strives to minimise multisystem organ failure and of those that survive, individuals can present with profound rehabilitation needs. The purpose of this case series is to describe occupational therapy (OT) and special technology considerations for three male Veteran patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Methods: This is a descriptive case series using a retrospective electronic health record review at a Veterans Administration hospital. The case series includes three male Veterans with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ages 69-78) who were referred to OT. The cases were selected to demonstrate the novel use of technology and strategies to reduce the risk of transmission. In two of three of our cases, we describe acute rehabilitation with a focus on activity tolerance, participation in occupations, and discharge planning. In all cases, we measured vital signs and activity tolerance as primary outcomes. Results and conclusions: The findings suggest that outcome measures focussing on activity tolerance to maintain stable vital signs during the recovery phase is central to the progression of activities. We observed in our cases that the Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance (PEOP) model can guide practice and complement the medical model in management of these patients. We utilised technology to engage family members in the rehabilitation care and minimise exposure risks. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Acute occupational therapy for rehabilitation early in the recovery of Cornavirus-2019 can be guided by the Person-Occupation-Environment-Performance model as seen in this case series of three Veteran patients. Assistive technology can serve dual roles in supporting the rehabilitation of individuals with Cornavirus-2019 and lowering the risk of virus transmission to staff.",10.1080/17483107.2020.1852326,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633879850,"Rich, T ;Hicks, B ;Dahl, A ;Sullivan, E ;Barrett, B ;Bedore, B ",Disability and rehabilitation.

Most studies have addressed the impact on the aquatic environment, as water is an important source of anthropogenic pollutants. Few investigations have been conducted on terrestrial animals living near treatment ponds. We isolated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacter cloacae complex-producing strains from 35 clinical isolates, 29 samples of wastewater, 19 wild animals, and 10 domestic animals living in the hospital sewers and at or near a wastewater treatment plant to study the dissemination of clinically relevant resistance through hospital and urban effluents. After comparison of the antibiotic resistant profiles of E. cloacae complex strains, a more detailed analysis of 41 whole-genome-sequenced strains demonstrated that the most common sequence type, ST114 (n=20), was present in human (n=9) and non-human (n=11) samples, with a close genetic relatedness. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed local circulation of this pathogenic lineage in diverse animal species. In addition, nanopore sequencing and specific synteny of an IncHI2/ST1/blaCTX-M-15 plasmid recovered on the majority of these ST114 clones (n=18) indicated successful worldwide diffusion of this mobile genetic element.",10.1128/AAC.02146-20,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633883160,"Pot, M ;Guyomard-Rabenirina, S ;Couvin, D ;Ducat, C ;Enouf, V ;Ferdinand, S ;Gruel, G ;Malpote, E ;Talarmin, A ;Breurec, S ;Reynaud, Y ",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,NA,endogenous compound;extended spectrum beta lactamase;Enterobacter cloacae;Guadeloupe;plasmid;animal experiment;antibiotic resistance;article;controlled study;diffusion;domestic animal;effluent;human;nanopore sequencing;nonhuman;sewer;synteny;waste water treatment plant;whole genome sequencing;wild animal,Article in Press,23 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
1,EM:L633990898,Effects of Mosquito Microbiota on the Survival Cost and Development Success of Avian Plasmodium,"Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect the capacity of mosquitoes for the transmission of vector-borne pathogens. Among them, mosquito microbiota may play a key role determining the development of pathogens in mosquitoes and the cost of infections. Here, we used a wild avian malaria-mosquito assemblage model to experimentally test the role of vector microbiota on the cost of infection and their consequences for parasite development. To do so, a cohort of Culex pipiens mosquitoes were treated with antibiotics, including gentamicin sulfate and penicillin-streptomycin, to alter their microbiota, and other cohort was treated with sterilized water as controls. Subsequently, both cohorts were allowed to feed on Plasmodium infected or uninfected house sparrows (Passer domesticus). The antibiotic treatment significantly increased the survival rate of mosquitoes fed on infected birds while this was not the case of mosquitoes fed on uninfected birds. Additionally, a higher prevalence of Plasmodium in the saliva of mosquitoes was found in antibiotic treated mosquitoes than in mosquitoes of the control group at 20 days post exposure (dpe). Analyses of the microbiota of a subsample of mosquitoes at 20 dpe suggest that although the microbiota diversity did not differ between individuals of the two treatments, microbiota in control mosquitoes had a higher number of unique features and enriched in biochemical pathways related to the immune system than antibiotic treated ones. In sum, this study provides support for the role of mosquito microbiota on mosquito survival and the presence of parasite DNA in their saliva.",10.3389/fmicb.2020.562220,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633990898,"Martínez-de la Puente, J ;Gutiérrez-López, R ;Díez-Fernández, A ;Soriguer, R C ;Moreno-Indias, I ;Figuerola, J ",Frontiers in Microbiology,Culex pipiens;ecology-diseases;malaria;microbiome;parasite transmission;vector-borne pathogens;virulence,gentamicin;streptomycin;unclassified drug;water;avian malaria;Culex pipiens;ecology;infectious agent;microbiome;parasite transmission;Passer domesticus;adult;antibiotic therapy;article;cohort analysis;controlled study;drug combination;drug therapy;female;human;immune system;male;mosquito control;nonhuman;parasite development;prevalence;saliva;survival rate,Article,13 Jan 2021,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
2,EM:L633980365,Identifying Transcriptomic Signatures and Rules for SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The world-wide Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was triggered by the widespread of a new strain of coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Multiple studies on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted immediately after the spread of the disease. However, the molecular pathogenesis of the virus and related diseases has still not been fully revealed. In this study, we attempted to identify new transcriptomic signatures as candidate diagnostic models for clinical testing or as therapeutic targets for vaccine design. Using the recently reported transcriptomics data of upper airway tissue with acute respiratory illnesses, we integrated multiple machine learning methods to identify effective qualitative biomarkers and quantitative rules for the distinction of SARS-CoV-2 infection from other infectious diseases. The transcriptomics data was first analyzed by Boruta so that important features were selected, which were further evaluated by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance method. A feature list was produced. This list was fed into the incremental feature selection, incorporating some classification algorithms, to extract qualitative biomarker genes and construct quantitative rules. Also, an efficient classifier was built to identify patients infected with SARS-COV-2.

3,EM:L633950211,Characterization of Treponema pallidum Dissemination in C57BL/6 Mice,"The spirochetal pathogen Treponema pallidum causes 5 million new cases of venereal syphilis worldwide each year. One major obstacle to syphilis prevention and treatment is the lack of suitable experimental animal models to study its pathogenesis. Accordingly, in this study, we further evaluated the responses of mice to Treponema pallidum. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that Treponema pallidum could colonize the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and testicles of C57BL/6 mice, and the organism may be able to rapidly penetrate the blood-brain barrier in mice by 24 h after infection. In subsequent rabbit infectivity tests, we observed evident signs of the microorganism in the mouse lymph node suspension. After infection, bacterial loads were higher in the tissues than in the blood of C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, a significant Th1 immune response was recorded by cytokine assays. Flow cytometric analysis suggested an obvious increase in the proportion of CD3(+) T and CD4(+) T cells in the spleen cells in the infected mice. Thus, improving our understanding of the response of C57BL/6 mice for Treponema pallidum will help to comprehensive elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of this bacterium and lay the foundation for the development of a new research model of Treponema pallidum.",10.3389/fimmu.2020.577129,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633950211,"Lu, S ;Zheng, K ;Wang, J ;Xu, M ;Xie, Y ;Yuan, S ;Wang, C ;Wu, Y ",Frontiers in Immunology,bacterial dissemination;C57BL/6 mice;inflammation;quantitative polymerase chain reaction;Treponema pallidum,CD3 antigen ;Treponema pallidum;animal cell;animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;apoptosis;article;bacterial infection;bacterial load;blood brain barrier;CD4+ T lymphocyte;CD8+ T lymphocyte;cell infiltration;controlled study;corpus cavernosum;DNA extraction;enzyme linked immunosorbent assay;flow cytometry;gene amplification;globus pallidus;heart;histology;histopathology;hypersensitivity;immune response;immunophenotyping;inflammation;kidney;Leporidae;liver;lymph node;macrophage;male;microglia;mouse;New Zealand rabbit;nonhuman;orchitis;pathogen load;polymerase chain reaction;prevalence;quantitative analysis;real time polymerase chain reaction;seroconversion;spleen cell;suspension;syphilis;testis;tumor associated leukocyte,Article,8 Jan 2021,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
4,EM:L633950296,"Prevalence and Predictors of Antimicrobial Resistance Among Enterococcus spp. From Dogs Presented at a Veterinary Teaching Hospital, South Africa","Background: While surveillance of antimicrobial drug resistance is ongoing in human medicine in South Africa, there is no such activity being performed in veterinary medicine. As a result, there is a need to investigate antimicrobial resistance among enterococci isolated from dogs in South Africa to improve understanding of the status of antimicrobial drug resistance given its public and veterinary public health importance. This study investigated antimicrobial resistance and factors associated with resistance profiles of enterococci isolated from dogs presented for veterinary care at a veterinary teaching hospital in South Africa. Methods: In total 102 Enterococcus isolated between 2007 and 2011 by a bacteriology laboratory at a teaching hospital were included in this study. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined against a panel of 18 antimicrobials using the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion technique. Univariate analysis was used to assess simple associations between year, season, breed group, age group, sex, and specimen as covariates and extensive drug resistance (XDR) as the outcome. Variables that were significant in the univariate analysis at a generous p-value ≤ 0.2 were included in the multivariable logistic models to investigate predictors of XDR. Results: All the Enterococcus isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial. High proportions of isolates were resistant against lincomycin (93%), kanamycin (87%), orbifloxacin (85%), and aminogycoside-lincosamide (77%). Ninety three percent (93%), 35.3, and 8.8% of the isolates exhibited multi-drug, extensive-drug and pan-drug resistance, respectively. Only year was significantly (p = 0.019) associated with extensive-drug resistance. Conclusion: Given the zoonotic potential of Enterococcus spp., the high antimicrobial resistance and multi-drug resistance observed in this study are a public health concern from one health perspective. The identified resistance to various antimicrobials may be useful in guiding clinicians especially in resource scarce settings where it is not always possible to perform AST when making treatment decisions.",10.3389/fvets.2020.589439,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633950296,"Oguttu, J W ;Qekwana, D N ;Odoi, A ",Frontiers in Veterinary Science,antimicrobial resistance;canine;dogs;enterococci;Enterococcus species;extensive-drug resistance;multi-drug resistance;pan-drug resistance,kanamycin;lincomycin;lincosamide;orbifloxacin;dog;Enterococcus;extensive drug resistance;multidrug resistance;prevalence;South Africa;teaching hospital;veterinary medicine;animal experiment;article;aspartate aminotransferase level;bacteriology;breed;controlled study;disk diffusion;female;groups by age;male;nonhuman;public health;season;univariate analysis,Article,7 Jan 2021,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
5,EM:L633953329,"Stroke Admissions, Stroke Severity, and Treatment Rates in Urban and Rural Areas During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Many regions worldwide reported a decline of stroke admissions during the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It remains unclear whether urban and rural regions experienced similar declines and whether deviations from historical admission numbers were more pronounced among specific age, stroke severity or treatment groups. Methods: We used registry datasets from (a) nine acute stroke hospitals in Berlin, and (b) nine hospitals from a rural TeleNeurology network in Northeastern Germany for primary analysis of 3-week-rolling average of stroke/TIA admissions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared course of stroke admission numbers with regional cumulative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) infections. In secondary analyses, we used emergency department logs of the Berlin Charité University hospital to investigate changes in age, stroke severity, and thrombolysis/thrombectomy frequencies during the early regional Sars-CoV-2 spread (March and April 2020) and compared them with preceding years. Results: Compared to past years, stroke admissions decreased by 20% in urban and 20-25% in rural hospitals. Deviations from historical averages were observable starting in early March and peaked when numbers of regional Sars-CoV-2 infections were still low. At the same time, average admission stroke severity and proportions of moderate/severe strokes (NIHSS >5) were 20 and 20–40% higher, respectively. There were no relevant deviations observed in proportions of younger patients (<65 years), proportions of patients with thrombolysis, or number of thrombectomy procedures. Stroke admissions at Charité subsequently rebounded and reached near-normal levels after 4 weeks when the number of new Sars-CoV-2 infections started to decrease. Conclusions: During the early pandemic, deviations of stroke-related admissions from historical averages were observed in both urban and rural regions of Northeastern Germany and appear to have been mainly driven by avoidance of admissions of mildly affected stroke patients.",10.3389/fneur.2020.607193,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633953329,"Erdur, H ;Siegerink, B ;Leithner, C ;Franke, C ;Lorenz-Meyer, I ;Theen, S ;Angermaier, A ;Kinze, S ;Weber, J E ;Rohmann, J L ;Scheitz, J F ;Nolte, C H ;Endres, M ;Audebert, H J ",Frontiers in Neurology,COVID19;epidemiology;public health;SARS-CoV-2;stroke,cerebrovascular accident ;university hospital;virus transmission,Article,6 Jan 2021,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to quantify treatment outcomes among children with HIV. Methods and analysis Systematic searches will be conducted in three electronic databases (PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science) for recent studies published from 01 Jan 2000 up to 28 October 2020, without geographical restriction. The primary outcomes of the study will be poor treatment outcomes, which include death, treatment failure and loss to follow-up. We will include quantitative studies that report treatment outcomes among children under the age of 18 years with HIV. Studies will be excluded if they are case report, case series, conducted among adults only or do not provide data on treatment outcomes for children. Two researchers will screen the titles and abstracts of all citations identified in our search, then review the full text of the remaining papers to identify those that meet the inclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be used for quality assessment. A random-effects meta-analysis will be used to obtain pooled estimates of the proportion of poor treatment outcomes. The heterogeneity between studies will be checked visually by using forest plots and quantitatively measured by the index of heterogeneity (I2). Pooled estimates of poor treatment outcomes will be calculated with a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis will be conducted by study settings, treatment regimen, comorbidity (such as tuberculosis), study period and HIV type (HIV-1 and HIV-2).

7,EM:L633907130,Pooled Plasmid Sequencing Reveals the Relationship Between Mobile Genetic Elements and Antimicrobial Resistance Genes in Clinically Isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae,"Plasmids remain important microbial components mediating the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. To systematically explore the relationship between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), a novel strategy using single-molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing was developed. This approach was applied to pooled conjugative plasmids from clinically isolated multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae from a tertiary referral hospital over a 9-month period. The conjugative plasmid pool was obtained from transconjugants that acquired antimicrobial resistance after plasmid conjugation with 53 clinical isolates. The plasmid pool was then subjected to SMRT sequencing, and 82 assembled plasmid fragments were obtained. In total, 124 ARGs (responsible for resistance to β-lactam, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside, among others) and 317 MGEs [including transposons (Tns), insertion sequences (ISs), and integrons] were derived from these fragments. Most of these ARGs were linked to MGEs, allowing for the establishment of a relationship network between MGEs and/or ARGs that can be used to describe the dissemination of resistance by mobile elements. Key elements involved in resistance transposition were identified, including IS26, Tn3, IS903B, ISEcp1, and ISKpn19. As the most predominant IS in the network, a typical IS26-mediated multicopy composite transposition event was illustrated by tracing its flanking 8-bp target site duplications (TSDs). The landscape of the pooled plasmid sequences highlights the diversity and complexity of the relationship between MGEs and ARGs, underpinning the clinical value of dominant HGT profiles.",10.1016/j.gpb.2020.12.002,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633907130,"Jiang, Y ;Wang, Y ;Hua, X ;Qu, Y ;Peleg, A Y ;Yu, Y ","Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",Horizontal transfer profile;Insertion sequence;Plasmid;Single-molecule real time sequencing;Transconjugant,aminoglycoside;endogenous compound;beta-lactam resistance;conjugative plasmid;gene insertion sequence;integron;multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae;article;horizontal gene transfer;nonhuman;tertiary care center,Article in Press,29 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
8,EM:L2010520698,A dual-therapy approach for the treatment of biofilm-mediated Salmonella gallbladder carriage,"Asymptomatic carriage of Salmonella Typhi continues to facilitate the transmission of typhoid fever, resulting in 14 million new infections and 136,000 fatalities each year. Asymptomatic chronic carriage of S. Typhi is facilitated by the formation of biofilms on gallstones that protect the bacteria from environmental insults and immune system clearance. Here, we identified two unique small molecules capable of both inhibiting Salmonella biofilm growth and disrupting pre-formed biofilm structures without affecting bacterial viability. In a mouse model of chronic gallbladder Salmonella carriage, treatment with either compound reduced bacterial burden in the gallbladder by 1–2 logs resulting in bacterial dissemination to peripheral organs that was associated with increased mortality. Co-administration of either compound with ciprofloxacin not only enhanced compound efficacy in the gallbladder by a further 1–1.5 logs for a total of 3–4.5 log reduction, but also prevented bacterial dissemination to peripheral organs. These data suggest a dual-therapy approach targeting both biofilm and planktonic populations can be further developed as a safe and efficient treatment of biofilm-mediated chronic S. Typhi infections.",10.1371/journal.ppat.1009192,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L2010520698,"Sandala, J L ;Eichar, B W ;Kuo, L G ;Hahn, M M ;Basak, A K ;Huggins, W M ;Woolard, K ;Melander, C ;Gunn, J S ",PLoS Pathogens,NA,ciprofloxacin;biofilm;gallbladder tissue;Salmonella;article;bacterial clearance;bacterial load;bacterial viability;column chromatography;confocal microscopy;immune system;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;mass spectrometry;minimum inhibitory concentration;nonhuman;particle size;plankton;polymerization;proteomics;typhoid fever,Article,28 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
9,EM:L2010574838,"The COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan, China: Epidemiology and impact of interventions","In January 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak was detected in Sichuan Province of China. Six weeks later, the outbreak was successfully contained. The aim of this work is to characterize the epidemiology of the Sichuan outbreak and estimate the impact of interventions in limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We analyzed patient records for all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020. To estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers, we used a Bayesian framework. In addition, we estimate the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies. The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. We estimated R(0) at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6–3.7). The epidemic was self-sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by Sichuan authorities. Our findings indicate that, were the control measures be adopted four weeks later, the epidemic could have lasted 49 days longer (95% CI: 31–68 days), causing 9,216 more cases (95% CI: 1,317–25,545).",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008467,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L2010574838,"Liu, Q -H ;Bento, A I ;Yang, K ;Zhang, H ;Yang, X ;Merler, S ;Vespignani, A ;Lv, J ;Yu, H ;Zhang, W ;Zhou, T ;Ajelli, M ",PLoS Computational Biology,NA,coronavirus disease 2019 ;disease surveillance;adolescent;adult;age distribution;aged;article;basic reproduction number;child;China;control strategy;epidemic;female;human;intervention study;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;public health;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;trend study;virus transmission,Article,28 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
10,EM:L633884384,"Emergence and dissemination of three mild outbreaks of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with high-level resistance to azithromycin in Barcelona, 2016-18","BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) isolates with high-level azithromycin resistance (HL-AziR) have emerged worldwide in recent decades, threatening the sustainability of current dual-antimicrobial therapy. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize the first 16 NG isolates with HL-AziR in Barcelona between 2016 and 2018. METHODS: WGS was used to identify the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, to establish the MLST ST, NG multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) ST and NG sequence typing for antimicrobial resistance (NG-STAR) ST and to identify the clonal relatedness of the isolates with other closely related NG previously described in other countries based on a whole-genome SNP analysis approach. The sociodemographic characteristics of the patients included in the study were collected by comprehensive review of their medical records. RESULTS: Twelve out of 16 HL-AziR isolates belonged to the MLST ST7823/NG-MAST ST5309 genotype and 4 to MLST ST9363/NG-MAST ST3935. All presented the A2059G mutation in all four alleles of the 23S rRNA gene. MLST ST7823/NG-MAST ST5309 isolates were only identified in men who have sex with women and MLST ST9363/NG-MAST ST3935 were found in MSM. Phylogenomic analysis revealed the presence of three transmission clusters of three different NG strains independently associated with sexual behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the first appearance of three mild outbreaks of NG with HL-AziR in Spain. These results highlight the continuous capacity of NG to develop antimicrobial resistance and spread among sexual networks. The enhanced resolution of WGS provides valuable information for outbreak investigation, complementing the implementation of public health measures focused on the prevention and dissemination of MDR NG.",10.1093/jac/dkaa536,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633884384,"Salmerón, P ;Moreno-Mingorance, A ;Trejo, J ;Amado, R ;Viñado, B ;Cornejo-Sanchez, T ;Alberny, M ;Barbera, M J ;Arando, M ;Pumarola, T ;Hoyos-Mallecot, Y ;Serra-Pladevall, J ;González-López, J J ",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,NA,azithromycin;endogenous compound;RNA 23S;Neisseria gonorrhoeae;adult;antibiotic resistance;article;case report;clinical article;demography;female;gene frequency;genotype;human;male;medical record;men who have sex with men;nonhuman;public health;sexual behavior;single nucleotide polymorphism;Spain,Article in Press,26 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv

However, with the widespread and abuse of antibiotics, many pathogens have developed resistance, and even ""Super Bacteria"" resistance to multiple drugs have evolved. In the arms race between humans and pathogens, humans are about to face a situation where no medicine is available. Research on microbial antibiotic resistance genes, resistance mechanisms, and the spread of resistance has attracted the attention of many scientific researchers, and various antibiotic resistance gene databases and analysis tools have emerged. In this review, we collect the current databases that focus on antibiotics resistance genes, and discuss these databases in terms of database types, data characteristics, antibiotics resistance gene prediction models and the types of analyzable sequences.

13,EM:L633865892,Pre-radiofrequency ablation MRI imaging features predict the local tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma,"ABSTRACT: To investigate whether MRI features could preoperatively predict local tumor progression (LTP) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as the first-line treatment and improve a novel predictive model through developing a nomogram including various conventional MRI parameters. 105 patients with HCCs who had received RFA were enrolled. All patients had undergone conventional MRI before RFA. Uni- and multivariable analyses for LTP were assessing using a Cox proportional hazards model. The developed MRI-based nomogram was further designed based on multivariable logistic analysis in our study and the usefulness of the developed model was validated according to calibration curves and the C-index. Rim enhancement (hazard ratio: 2.689, P = .044) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values (hazard ratio: 0.055, P = .038) were statistically significant independent predictors of LTP after RFA at multivariable analysis. The performance of the nomogram incorporating two MRI parameters (with a C-index of 0.782) was improved compared with that based on rim enhancement and ADC alone (with C-index values of 0.630 and 0.728, respectively). The calibration curve of the MRI-based nomogram showed good conformance between evaluation and observation at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 years after RFA. The preliminary predictive model based on MRI findings including rim enhancement and ADC value could be used preoperatively to estimate the risk of LTP of HCC after RFA as the first-line treatment.",10.1097/MD.0000000000023924,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633865892,"Hu, Z ;Yu, N ;Wang, H ;Li, S ;Yan, J ;Zhang, G ",Medicine,NA,diagnosis;liver cell carcinoma ;nomogram;procedures;radiofrequency ablation;adverse event;diagnostic imaging;female;human;liver;male;middle aged;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;pathology;preoperative care;prognosis;reproducibility;tumor recurrence,Article,24 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv

15,EM:L633760045,Assessment of Air Contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in Hospital Settings,"Importance: Controversy remains regarding the transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objective: To review current evidence on air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings and the factors associated with contamination, including viral load and particle size. Evidence Review: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically queried for original English-language articles detailing SARS-CoV-2 air contamination in hospital settings between January 1 and October 27, 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patients. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per meter cubed of air were pooled, and their distribution was described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per meter cubed were analyzed after categorization as less than 1 μm, from 1 to 4 μm, and greater than 4 μm. Findings: Among 2284 records identified, 24 cross-sectional observational studies were included in the review. Overall, 82 of 471 air samples (17.4%) from close patient environments were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a significantly higher positivity rate in intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 of 107 [25.2%] vs non-intensive care unit, 39 of 364 [10.7%]; P <.001). There was no difference according to the distance from patients (≤1 m, 3 of 118 [2.5%] vs >1-5 m, 13 of 236 [5.5%]; P =.22). The positivity rate was 5 of 21 air samples (23.8%) in toilets, 20 of 242 (8.3%) in clinical areas, 15 of 122 (12.3%) in staff areas, and 14 of 42 (33.3%) in public areas. A total of 81 viral cultures were performed across 5 studies, and 7 (8.6%) from 2 studies were positive, all from close patient environments. The median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.0 × 10(3)copies/m(3)(0.4 × 10(3)to 3.1 × 10(3)copies/m(3)) in clinical areas to 9.7 × 10(3)copies/m(3)(5.1 × 10(3)to 14.3 × 10(3)copies/m(3)) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. Protective equipment removal and patient rooms had high concentrations per titer of SARS-CoV-2 (varying from 0.9 × 10(3)to 40 × 10(3)copies/m(3)and 3.8 × 10(3)to 7.2 × 10(3)TCID50/m(3)), with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the region of particle size less than 1 μm; staff offices had peaks in the region of particle size greater than 4 μm. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review, the air close to and distant from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, few of these samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found in toilets and bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways suggest that these areas should be carefully considered.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33232,https://www.embase.com/a/#/search/results?id=L633760045,"Birgand, G ;Peiffer-Smadja, N ;Fournier, S ;Kerneis, S ;Lescure, F -X ;Lucet, J -C ",JAMA Network Open,NA,virus RNA ;air pollution;coronavirus disease 2019;hospital;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;viral contamination;aerosol;air sampling;article;artificial ventilation;bath;human;infection risk;infectious dose;intensive care unit;medical staff;nonhuman;particle size;priority journal;protective equipment;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;systematic review;tissue culture;toilet;ventilator;virus culture;virus load,Article,23 Dec 2020,Embase,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Embase_parsed.csv
16,EM:L633838902,Intracellular Porphyromonas gingivalis Promotes the Proliferation of Colorectal Cancer Cells via the MAPK/ERK Signaling Pathway,"Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a keystone pathogen in periodontitis. However, several clinical studies have revealed an enrichment of P. gingivalis in the stool samples and colorectal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether P. gingivalis can promote colorectal cancer progression in vitro. We established an acute infection model (24 h, multiplicity of infection =100) of P. gingivalis invasion of colorectal cancer cells to study the alterations induced by P. gingivalis in the proliferation and cell cycle of colorectal cancer cells. We observed that P. gingivalis can adhere and invade host cells a few hours after infection. Once invaded, P. gingivalis significantly promoted colorectal cancer cell proliferation, and the percentage of S phase cells was increased in the cell cycle assay. However, KDP136, a gingipain-deficient mutant of P. gingivalis 33277, showed a decreased ability to promote colorectal cancer cell proliferation, indicating that gingipain is associated with colorectal cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we extracted RNA from colorectal cancer cells for high-throughput sequencing analysis and reconfirmed the results by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The results suggested that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is significantly activated by P. gingivalis, while these changes were not observed for KDP136. In conclusion, P. gingivalis can invade cells and promote the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells by activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.

17,EM:L633877311,Lyme Disease Pathogenesis,"Lyme disease Borrelia are obligately parasitic, tick- transmitted, invasive, persistent bacterial pathogens that cause disease in humans and non-reservoir vertebrates primarily through the induction of inflammation. During transmission from the infected tick, the bacteria undergo significant changes in gene expression, resulting in adaptation to the mammalian environment. The organisms multiply and spread locally and induce inflammatory responses that, in humans, result in clinical signs and symptoms. Borrelia virulence involves a multiplicity of mechanisms for dissemination and colonization of multiple tissues and evasion of host immune responses. Most of the tissue damage, which is seen in non-reservoir hosts, appears to result from host inflammatory reactions, despite the low numbers of bacteria in affected sites. This host response to the Lyme disease Borrelia can cause neurologic, cardiovascular, arthritic, and dermatologic manifestations during the disseminated and persistent stages of infection. The mechanisms by which a paucity of organisms (in comparison to many other infectious diseases) can cause varied and in some cases profound inflammation and symptoms remains mysterious but are the subjects of diverse ongoing investigations.

18,EM:L633879850,Preliminary experiences in acute occupational therapy for in-patients with coronavirus-19 (COVID-19): leveraging assistive technology in three case studies of male veterans,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019 with millions of cases reported globally in the succeeding months. Initial hospitalisation strives to minimise multisystem organ failure and of those that survive, individuals can present with profound rehabilitation needs. The purpose of this case series is to describe occupational therapy (OT) and special technology considerations for three male Veteran patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Methods: This is a descriptive case series using a retrospective electronic health record review at a Veterans Administration hospital. The case series includes three male Veterans with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ages 69-78) who were referred to OT. The cases were selected to demonstrate the novel use of technology and strategies to reduce the risk of transmission. In two of three of our cases, we describe acute rehabilitation with a focus on activity tolerance, participation in occupations, and discharge planning. In all cases, we measured vital signs and activity tolerance as primary outcomes. Results and conclusions: The findings suggest that outcome measures focussing on activity tolerance to maintain stable vital signs during the recovery phase is central to the progression of activities. We observed in our cases that the Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance (PEOP) model can guide practice and complement the medical model in management of these patients. We utilised technology to engage family members in the rehabilitation care and minimise exposure risks. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Acute occupational therapy for rehabilitation early in the recovery of Cornavirus-2019 can be guided by the Person-Occupation-Environment-Performance model as seen in this case series of three Veteran patients.

We isolated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacter cloacae complex-producing strains from 35 clinical isolates, 29 samples of wastewater, 19 wild animals, and 10 domestic animals living in the hospital sewers and at or near a wastewater treatment plant to study the dissemination of clinically relevant resistance through hospital and urban effluents. After comparison of the antibiotic resistant profiles of E. cloacae complex strains, a more detailed analysis of 41 whole-genome-sequenced strains demonstrated that the most common sequence type, ST114 (n=20), was present in human (n=9) and non-human (n=11) samples, with a close genetic relatedness. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed local circulation of this pathogenic lineage in diverse animal species.
