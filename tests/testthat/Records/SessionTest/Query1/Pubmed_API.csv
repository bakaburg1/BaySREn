1,PMID:34940026,Association and Risk Factors for Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Cardiovascular Diseases: A Systematic Review.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition. Epidemiologic studies show that sleep apnea increases cardiovascular diseases risk factors including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. OSA is also responsible for serious illnesses such as congestive heart failure, stroke, arrhythmias, and bronchial asthma. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate evidence for the association between OSA and cardiovascular disease morbidities and identify risk factors for the conditions. In a review of 34 studies conducted in 28 countries with a sample of 37,599 people, several comorbidities were identified in patients with severe OSA-these were: heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, asthma, COPD, acute heart failure, chronic heart failure, hyperlipidemia, thyroid disease, cerebral infarct or embolism, myocardial infarction, and psychological comorbidities including stress and depression. Important risk factors contributing to OSA included: age > 35 years;  BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2); alcoholism; higher Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS); mean apnea duration; oxygen desaturation index (ODI); and nocturnal oxygen desaturation (NOD). Severe OSA (AHI >/= 30) was significantly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and oxygen desaturation index. The risk of OSA and associated  disease morbidities can be reduced by controlling overweight/obesity, alcoholism, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.",10.3390/diseases9040088,"Mitra, Amal K; Bhuiyan, Azad R; Jones, Elizabeth A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940026,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",Diseases,Journal Article; Review,NA,age; apnea-hypoxia index (AHI); cardiovascular disease; diabetes; hypertension; obesity; risk factors; sleep apnea,2021 Dec 2,Pubmed,API,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_API.csv
2,PMID:34937723,"Effect of computerised, knowledge-based, clinical decision support systems on patient-reported and clinical outcomes of patients with chronic disease managed in primary care settings: a systematic review.","OBJECTIVES: Chronic diseases are the leading cause of disability globally. Most chronic disease management occurs in primary care with outcomes varying across primary care providers. Computerised clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been shown to positively affect clinician behaviour by improving adherence to clinical guidelines. This study provides a summary of the available evidence on the effect of CDSS embedded in electronic health records on patient-reported and clinical outcomes of adult patients with chronic disease managed in primary care. DESIGN AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic review, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi-RCTs, interrupted time series and controlled before-and-after studies, assessing the effect of CDSS (vs usual care) on patient-reported or clinical outcomes of adult patients with selected common chronic diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, myocardial ischaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, arthritis and osteoporosis) managed in primary care. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, Health Management Information Consortium and trial register clinicaltrials.gov were searched from inception to 24 June 2020. DATA EXTRACTION  AND SYNTHESIS: Screening, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two reviewers independently. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for quality appraisal. RESULTS: From 5430 articles, 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous in population characteristics, intervention  components and outcome measurements and focused on diabetes, asthma, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. Most outcomes were clinical with one study reporting on patient-reported outcomes. Quality of the evidence was impacted by methodological biases of studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is inconclusive evidence in  support of CDSS. A firm inference on the intervention effect was not possible due to methodological biases and study heterogeneity. Further research is needed to provide evidence on the intervention effect and the interplay between healthcare  setting features, CDSS characteristics and implementation processes.

3,PMID:34749040,"Tai Chi for anxiety and depression symptoms in cancer, stroke, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Many middle-aged and older adults have more than one chronic health condition. It is therefore important to explore the effectiveness of interventions for multiple chronic conditions. Tai Chi is widely used in China and other countries, and many studies have examined the effect of Tai Chi on anxiety and depression. However, there are no systematic reviews of the effect of Tai Chi on anxiety and depression in various chronic conditions. This systematic  review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of Tai Chi on anxiety and  depression symptoms in four chronic conditions: cancer, stroke, heart failure (HF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We searched Chinese and English databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Database, and Sinomed) from inception to October 2020. Review Manager version 5.2 and Stata version 12.0 were used to perform a systematic review. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The study was registered with the PROSPERO database (number CRD42020209594). RESULTS: Of the 596 studies identified, we included 25 randomized controlled trials involving 1819 participants. Combined analysis of the four diseases showed statistically significant differences between the Tai Chi and control groups for anxiety symptoms (SMD -0.99, 95%CI: -1.5, -0.47; P < 0.01) and depressive symptoms (SMD 0.70, 95%CI: -1.01, -0.39; P < 0.01). Subgroup analyses showed statistically significant differences between the Tai Chi and control groups for depressive symptoms in stroke (SMD -0.43, 95%CI: -0.67, -0.18; P < 0.01) and HF (SMD -0.57, 95%CI: -0.8, -0.33; P < 0.01). However, no statistically significant differences were found for depressive symptoms in COPD  or cancer. There were statistically significant differences between the Tai Chi and control groups for anxiety symptoms in stroke (SMD -0.60, 95%CI: -0.88, -0.32; P < 0.01) and cancer (SMD -0.69, 95%CI: -1.22, -0.17; P < 0.01), but not in COPD or HF. Subgroup, sensitivity, meta regression, and publication bias analyses showed high heterogeneity correlated with a single study and study quality. Sensitivity analysis showed that most meta-analysis results had good stability, but those for anxiety symptoms in COPD were unstable; therefore, careful interpretation is required. CONCLUSION: Tai Chi has a positive effect on  anxiety and depression, especially for patients with cancer, stroke, and HF. However, given the weak evidence, this approach is not a substitute for psychiatric treatment.",10.1016/j.ctcp.2021.101510,"Cai, Qian; Cai, Shu-Bin; Chen, Jian-Kun; Bai, Xiao-Hui; Jing, Chun-Xiang; Zhang, Xi; Li, Ji-Qiang",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34749040,Complementary therapies in clinical practice,Complement Ther Clin Pract,Journal Article; Review,NA,Anxiety; Cancer; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Depression; Heart failure; Stroke; Tai chi,2021 Nov 2,Pubmed,API,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_API.csv
4,PMID:34674338,Hospitalised versus outpatient COVID-19 patients' background characteristics and  comorbidities: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to systematically assess COVID-19 patient background characteristics and pre-existing comorbidities associated with hospitalisation status. The meta-analysis included cross-sectional, cohort, and case-series studies with information on hospitalisation versus outpatient status for COVID-19 patients, with background characteristics and pre-existing comorbidities. A total of 1,002,006 patients from 40 studies were identified. Significantly higher odds  of hospitalisation were observed in Black individuals (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.70), males (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.43-1.76), and persons with current/past smoking (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.34-1.88). Additionally, individuals with pre-existing comorbidities were more likely to be hospitalised [asthma (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.02-1.45), COPD (OR = 3.68, 95% CI: 2.97-4.55), congestive heart failure (OR = 6.80, 95% CI: 4.97-9.31), coronary heart disease (OR = 4.40, 95% CI: 3.15-6.16), diabetes (OR = 3.90, 95% CI: 3.29-4.63), hypertension (OR = 3.89, 95% CI: 3.34-4.54), obesity (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.59-2.46) and renal chronic disease (OR = 5.84, 95% CI: 4.51-7.56)]. High heterogeneity and low publication bias among all factors were found. Age was not included due to the large variability in the estimates reported. In this systematic review/meta-analysis for patients with COVID-19, Black patients, males, persons who smoke, and those with pre-existing comorbidities were more likely to be hospitalised than their counterparts.

5,PMID:34607811,Prediction of incident atrial fibrillation in community-based electronic health records: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common and is associated with an increased risk of stroke. We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse multivariable  prediction models derived and/or validated in electronic health records (EHRs) and/or administrative claims databases for the prediction of incident AF in the community. METHODS: Ovid Medline and Ovid Embase were searched for records from inception to 23 March 2021. Measures of discrimination were extracted and pooled  by Bayesian meta-analysis, with heterogeneity assessed through a 95% prediction interval (PI). Risk of bias was assessed using Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool and certainty in effect estimates by Grading of Recommendations,  Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS: Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, describing nine prediction models, with four eligible for meta-analysis including 9 289 959 patients. The CHADS (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension,  Age>75, Diabetes mellitus, prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack) (summary c-statistic 0.674; 95% CI 0.610 to 0.732; 95% PI 0.526-0.815), CHA2DS2-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age>75 (2 points), Stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism (2 points), Vascular disease, Age 65-74, Sex category) (summary c-statistic 0.679; 95% CI 0.620 to 0.736; 95% PI 0.531-0.811)  and HATCH (Hypertension, Age, stroke or Transient ischemic attack, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Heart failure) (summary c-statistic 0.669; 95% CI  0.600 to 0.732; 95% PI 0.513-0.803) models resulted in a c-statistic with a statistically significant 95% PI and moderate discriminative performance. No model met eligibility for inclusion in meta-analysis if studies at high risk of bias were excluded and certainty of effect estimates was 'low'. Models derived by machine learning demonstrated strong discriminative performance, but lacked rigorous external validation. CONCLUSIONS: Models externally validated for prediction of incident AF in community-based EHR demonstrate moderate predictive  ability and high risk of bias. Novel methods may provide stronger discriminative  performance.

6,PMID:34526053,Assessing the usability of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity in chronic conditions: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organisation's global strategy for digital health emphasises the importance of patient involvement. Understanding the usability and acceptability of wearable devices is a core component of this. However, usability assessments to date have focused predominantly on healthy adults. There is a need to understand the patient perspective of wearable devices in participants with chronic health conditions. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify any study design that included a usability assessment of wearable devices to measure mobility, through gait and physical activity, within five cohorts with chronic conditions (Parkinson's disease [PD], multiple sclerosis [MS], congestive heart failure, [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder [COPD], and proximal femoral fracture [PFF]). RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were identified. Substantial heterogeneity in the quality of reporting, the methods used to assess usability, the devices used, and the aims of the studies precluded any meaningful comparisons. Questionnaires were used in the majority of studies (70.3%; n = 26)  with a reliance on intervention specific measures (n = 16; 61.5%). For those who  used interviews (n = 17; 45.9%), no topic guides were provided, while methods of  analysis were not reported in over a third of studies (n = 6; 35.3%). CONCLUSION: Usability of wearable devices is a poorly measured and reported variable in chronic health conditions. Although the heterogeneity in how these devices are implemented implies acceptance, the patient voice should not be assumed. In the absence of being able to make specific usability conclusions, the results of this review instead recommends that future research needs to: (1) Conduct usability assessments as standard, irrespective of the cohort under investigation or the type of study undertaken. (2) Adhere to basic reporting standards (e.g. COREQ) including the basic details of the study. Full copies of any questionnaires and interview guides should be supplied through supplemental files. (3) Utilise mixed methods research to gather a more comprehensive understanding of usability than either qualitative or quantitative research alone will provide. (4) Use previously validated questionnaires alongside any intervention specific measures.",10.1186/s12984-021-00931-2,"Keogh, Alison; Argent, Rob; Anderson, Amy; Caulfield, Brian; Johnston, William",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34526053,Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,J Neuroeng Rehabil,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review; Systematic Review",Adult; Exercise; Gait; Humans; *Multiple Sclerosis; User-Computer Interface; *Wearable Electronic Devices,*Gait; *Physical activity; *Usability; *User experience; *Wearable sensors,2021 Sep 15,Pubmed,API,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_API.csv
7,PMID:34490879,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guidelines for Perioperative Spine: Preoperative Pulmonary Evaluation and Optimization.,"BACKGROUND: There are no current recommendations for preoperative pulmonary evaluation and management of patients undergoing elective spine surgery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this guideline is to determine preoperative risk factors for perioperative and postoperative pulmonary adverse events and to determine the optimal preoperative evaluation and management of at-risk patients. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for studies relevant to postoperative pulmonary adverse events in patients undergoing spine surgery. Clinical studies evaluating preoperative patient risk factors and preoperative diagnostic and treatment interventions were selected for review. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 152 abstracts relevant to the PICO (patient/population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes) questions included in this chapter. The task force selected 65 articles for full-text review, and 24 were selected for inclusion in this systematic review. Twenty-three articles addressed preoperative patient risk factors. One article addressed preoperative diagnostic studies of pulmonary function. There were no studies meeting the inclusion criteria for preoperative pulmonary treatment. CONCLUSION: There is substantial evidence for multiple preoperative patient factors that predict an increased risk of a postoperative pulmonary adverse event. Individuals with these risk factors (functional dependence, advanced age [>/=65 yr], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, weight loss, and obstructive sleep apnea) who  are undergoing spine surgery should be counseled regarding the potential increased risk of a perioperative and postoperative pulmonary adverse events. There is insufficient evidence to support any specific preoperative diagnostic test for predicting the risk of postoperative pulmonary adverse events or any treatment intervention that reduces risk. It is suggested, however, to consider appropriate preoperative pulmonary diagnostic testing and treatment to address active pulmonary symptoms of existing or suspected disease.The full guidelines can be accessed at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/5-preoperative-pulmonary- evaluation-optimization.",10.1093/neuros/nyab319,"Mohamed, Basma; Wang, Marjorie C; Bisson, Erica F; Dimar, John; Harrop, James S; Hoh, Daniel J; Mummaneni, Praveen V; Dhall, Sanjay",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34490879,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,Journal Article,NA,Preoperative pulmonary assessment; Preoperative pulmonary optimization; Pulmonary diagnostic tests; Pulmonary treatment; Risk factors for pulmonary complications,2021 Oct 13,Pubmed,API,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_API.csv

Although iodinated contrast is not typically used in TEER, these patients are still at risk for developing AKI. METHODS: Studies reporting on the effect of incident AKI on mortality following TEER for MR were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed, comparing clinical outcomes between the patients with or without incident AKI. RESULTS: Six studies including a total of 2057 patients (377 AKI and 1680 No-AKI) were included and analyzed. AKI was significantly associated with 30-day mortality after TEER (Odds ratio (OR): 8.06; 95% CI: 3.20, 20.30, p < 0.01; I(2) = 18.4%) and all-cause mortality over a mean  follow-up time of 30 months (Hazard ratio (HR): 2.48; 95% CI: 1.89, 3.24, p < 0.01; I(2) = 23.7%). AKI after TEER was associated with prolonged hospitalization (Mean difference (in days): 1.41; 95% CI: 0.52, 2.31, p < 0.01; I(2) = 82.4%). Stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), device failure and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were significant predictors of AKI following TEER (CKD stage 4: OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.18, 4.78, p = 0.02; I(2) = 0.0%; Device failure: OR: 3.15; 95% CI: 1.94, 5.12, p < 0.01; I(2) = 0.0%; COPD: OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.16, 3.17; I(2) = 26.7%).

9,PMID:34277241,Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation for Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema  and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Prehospital and Emergency Settings.,"Non-invasive ventilation is an important intervention in treating acute respiratory failure caused by acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE) and acute  exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although there are studies that give evidence on the efficacy and safety of non-invasive ventilation over standard medical care for COPD and cardiogenic pulmonary edema, less are known about the form of non-invasive ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) as an effective intervention for respiratory failure and its efficacy and safety in prehospital settings. We conducted a systematic review by using PubMed and Google Scholar as  databases for collecting studies related to the effectiveness of CPAP and BiPAP for cardiogenic pulmonary edema and COPD; the major outcome studied was reducing  rates of endotracheal intubation secondary and tertiary outcomes included mortality reduction and shortening length of hospital stay. The study follows the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist 2009. Sixteen studies were identified, including systematic reviews, randomized control trials, and observational studies. Studies published on or after 2010 in a population greater than 40 years old suffering from acute COPD and cardiogenic pulmonary edema were taken for review. Studies that described other respiratory diseases treated with non-invasive ventilation were excluded. Quality appraisal was done using the Cochrane risk bias tool for randomized control trials, Amstar-2 for systematic reviews, and New Castle Ottawa Tool for observational studies. Five studies compared the effectiveness of CPAP and BiPAP with standard medical care in prehospital and emergency settings. Six studies described prehospital intervention. Both forms of non-invasive ventilation were equally significant and effective. Prehospital use had tremendously reduced intubation rates, with not much variability noticed for mortality and hospital stay. Non-invasive ventilation is an effective measure for respiratory failure secondary to COPD and ACPE. Early out of hospital utilization of CPAP and BiPAP reduces the rate of invasive ventilation and reduces complications due to endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal intubation is associated with a considerable incidence of complications like failed intubation, hypotension, or circulatory arrest, even if the emergency physician is well trained, making these forms of non-invasive ventilation safe and effective interventions in the prehospital settings.",10.7759/cureus.15624,"Abubacker, Ansha P; Ndakotsu, Andrew; Chawla, Harsh V; Iqbal, Aimen; Grewal, Amit; Myneni, Revathi; Vivekanandan, Govinathan; Khan, Safeera",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34277241,Cureus,Cureus,Journal Article; Review,NA,bipap; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; cpap; heart failure; non-invasive ventilation; pulmonary diseases; pulmonary edema,2021 Jun,Pubmed,API,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_API.csv
10,PMID:34263631,Predictors of mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection: a meta-analysis and a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Cases of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection have been increasing. Patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection have a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate. Identification of potential risk factors associated with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection-related mortality may help improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify articles describing predictors of mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. The quality of articles was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score (NOS). Review Manager was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-seven observational studies were included in the analysis. Factors associated with higher mortality were septic shock [odds ratio  (OR): 4.41, 95% CI: 3.17-6.15], congestive heart failure (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.71-4.13), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.87-3.15), chronic kidney disease (CKD; OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.43-2.22), diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.16-1.72), mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.25-2.18), and inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03-1.52). The average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score at the time of diagnosis of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was considerably higher in patients who did not survive than in those who survived (weighted mean difference: 5.86, 95% CI: 2.46-9.26). DISCUSSION: Patient condition, timing appropriate antimicrobial treatment, and disease severity according to the APACHE II score are the most important risk factors for death in patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Our finding may help predict patients' outcomes and improve management for them.

11,PMID:34253179,"Prevalence, aetiologies and prognosis of the symptom cough in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Cough is a relevant reason for encounter in primary care. For evidence-based decision making, general practitioners need setting-specific knowledge about prevalences, pre-test probabilities, and prognosis. Accordingly,  we performed a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies evaluating cough as reason for encounter in primary care. METHODS: We conducted a search in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Eligibility criteria and methodological quality were assessed independently by two reviewers. We extracted data on prevalence, aetiologies and  prognosis, and estimated the variation across studies. If justifiable in terms of heterogeneity, we performed a meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 21 eligible studies on prevalence, 12 on aetiology, and four on prognosis. Prevalence/incidence estimates were 3.8-4.2%/12.5% (Western primary care) and 10.3-13.8%/6.3-6.5% in Africa, Asia and South America. In Western countries the underlying diagnoses for acute cough or cough of all durations were respiratory tract infections (73-91.9%), influenza (6-15.2%), asthma (3.2-15%), laryngitis/tracheitis (3.6-9%), pneumonia (4.0-4.2%), COPD (0.5-3.3%), heart failure (0.3%), and suspected malignancy (0.2-1.8%). Median time for recovery was 9 to 11 days. Complete recovery was reported by 40.2- 67% of patients after two weeks, and by 79% after four weeks. About 21.1-35% of patients re-consulted; 0-1.3% of acute cough patients were hospitalized, none died. Evidence is missing  concerning subacute and chronic cough. CONCLUSION: Prevalences and incidences of  cough are high and show regional variation. Acute cough, mainly caused by respiratory tract infections, is usually self-limiting (supporting a ""wait-and-see"" strategy). We have no setting-specific evidence to support current guideline recommendations concerning subacute or chronic cough in Western primary care. Our study presents epidemiological data under non non-pandemic conditions.  It will be interesting to compare these data to future research results of the post-pandemic era.",10.1186/s12875-021-01501-0,"Bergmann, Milena; Haasenritter, Jorg; Beidatsch, Dominik; Schwarm, Sonja; Horner, Kaja; Bosner, Stefan; Grevenrath, Paula; Schmidt, Laura; Viniol, Annika; Donner-Banzhoff, Norbert; Becker, Annette",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34253179,BMC family practice,BMC Fam Pract,Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Review,Chronic Disease; *Cough/epidemiology/etiology; Humans; Prevalence; *Primary Health Care; Prognosis,*Aetiology; *Cough; *Diagnosis; *General practice; *Prevalence; *Primary care; *Prognosis; *Symptom-evaluating study; *Systematic review,2021 Jul 12,Pubmed,API,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_API.csv
12,PMID:34166630,Examining variation in the measurement of multimorbidity in research: a systematic review of 566 studies.,"BACKGROUND: A systematic understanding of how multimorbidity has been constructed and measured is unavailable. This review aimed to examine the definition and measurement of multimorbidity in peer-reviewed studies internationally. METHODS:  We systematically reviewed studies on multimorbidity, via a search of nine bibliographic databases (Ovid [PsycINFO, Embase, Global Health, and MEDLINE], Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global), from inception to Jan 21, 2020. Reference lists and tracked citations of retrieved articles were hand-searched. Eligible studies were full-text articles measuring multimorbidity for any purpose in community, primary care, care home, or hospital populations receiving a non-specialist service. Abstracts, qualitative research, and case series were excluded. Two reviewers independently reviewed the retrieved studies with conflicts resolved by discussion or a third reviewer, and a single researcher extracted data from published papers. To assess our objectives of how multimorbidity has been measured and examine variation in the chronic conditions included (in terms of number and type), we used descriptive analysis (frequencies, cross-tabulation, and negative binomial regression) to summarise the characteristics of multimorbidity studies and measures (study setting, source of morbidity data, study population, primary study purpose, and multimorbidity measure type). This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD420201724090. FINDINGS: 566 studies were included in our review, of which 206 (36.4%) did not report a reference definition for multimorbidity and 73 (12.9%) did not report the conditions their measure included. The number of conditions included in measures  ranged from two to 285 (median 17 [IQR 11-23). 452 (79.9%) studies reported types of condition within a single multimorbidity measure; most included at least one cardiovascular condition (441 [97.6%] of 452 studies), metabolic and endocrine condition (440 [97.3%]), respiratory condition (422 [93.4%]), musculoskeletal condition (396 [87.6%]), or mental health condition (355 [78.5%]) in their measure of multimorbidity. Chronic infections (123 [27.2%]), haematological conditions (110 [24.3%]), ear, nose, and throat conditions (107 [23.7%]), skin conditions (70 [15.5%]), oral conditions (19 [4.2%]), and congenital conditions (14 [3.1%]) were uncommonly included. Only eight individual conditions were included by more than half of studies in the multimorbidity measure used (diabetes, stroke, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure), with individual mental health conditions under-represented. Of the 566 studies, 419 were rated to be of moderate risk of bias, 107 of high risk of bias, and 40 of low risk of bias according to the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool. INTERPRETATION: Measurement of multimorbidity is poorly  reported and highly variable. Consistent reporting of measure definitions should  be required by journals, and consensus studies are needed to define core and study-dependent conditions to include in measures of multimorbidity.

13,PMID:34048921,Misdiagnosis of Heart Failure: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease associated with a significant burden to patients, families, and health services. The diagnosis of HF can be easily missed owing to similar symptoms with other conditions especially respiratory diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic review to determine the rates of HF and cardiomyopathy misdiagnosis and explored the potential causes. The included studies were narratively synthesized. Ten studies  were identified including a total of 223,859 patients. There was a lack of definition of HF misdiagnosis in the studies and inconsistent diagnostic criteria were used. The rates of HF misdiagnosis ranged from 16.1% in hospital setting to  68.5% when general practitioner referred patients to specialist setting. The most common cause for misdiagnosis was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). One study using a COPD cohort showed that HF was unrecognized in 20.5% of patients and 8.1% had misdiagnosis of HF as COPD. Another study suggests that anemia and chronic kidney disease are associated with an increase in the odds of  unrecognized left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Other comorbidities such as obesity, old age, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart disease are prevalent in patients with a misdiagnosis of HF. CONCLUSIONS: The misdiagnosis of HF is an  unfortunate part of everyday clinical practice that occurs with a variable rate depending on the population studied. HF is frequently misdiagnosed as COPD. More  research is needed to better understand the missed opportunities to correctly diagnose HF so that harm to patients can be avoided and effective treatments can  be implemented.",10.1016/j.cardfail.2021.05.014,"Wong, Chun Wai; Tafuro, Jacopo; Azam, Ziyad; Satchithananda, Duwarakan; Duckett, Simon; Barker, Diane; Patwala, Ashish; Ahmed, Fozia Z; Mallen, Christian; Kwok, Chun Shing",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34048921,Journal of cardiac failure,J Card Fail,Journal Article; Systematic Review,"Chronic Disease; Comorbidity; Diagnostic Errors; *Heart Failure/diagnosis/epidemiology; Humans; *Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/diagnosis/epidemiology",*Heart failure; *diagnosis; *misdiagnosis; *systematic review,2021 Sep,Pubmed,API,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_API.csv
14,PMID:34033730,The impacts of parity on spirometric parameters: a systematic review.,"Introduction: The relationship between parity and health outcomes has been debated in the scientific literature in terms of 'selection-pressure'. However, no previous review has raised the impacts of parity on spirometric parameters. This Systematic Review aimed to review the impacts of parity on spirometric parameters.Areas covered: PubMed and Scopus were searched on October 1(st), 2020, using the combination of the following two medical subject headings: 'Parity' and 'Respiratory Function Tests'. Only original articles published in English/French  were retained. Ten studies investigated the impacts of parity on spirometric parameters: six included healthy females, three involved unhealthy females [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, defect in protease inhibitor, and some other conditions] and one included a mixed population of healthy/unhealthy females. The studies reported conflicting results: no impact, positive impact (multiparity is associated with larger forced-expiratory-volume in one second, forced- and slow- vital-capacity, and inspiratory-capacity), or negative impact (multiparous females has lower bronchial flows, higher static volumes, an accelerated lung-aging, a tendency to an obstructive-ventilatory-defect and/or to lung-hyperinflation, and increased protease inhibitor levels).Expert opinion: The ten studies presented some limitations that made data interpretation relatively difficult. Future research to identify the 'real' impact of parity on spirometric parameters are therefore encouraged.",10.1080/17476348.2021.1935246,"Triki, Leila; Ben Saad, Helmi",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34033730,Expert review of respiratory medicine,Expert Rev Respir Med,Journal Article; Systematic Review,"Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Parity; Pregnancy; *Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/diagnosis; Respiratory Function Tests; Spirometry",*Childbearing; *methodology; *parity; *plethysmography; *spirometry,2021 Sep,Pubmed,API,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_API.csv
15,PMID:33956691,Outpatient Total Shoulder Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review Evaluating Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness.,"BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic surgical procedures are increasingly being performed in outpatient settings. The drive for cost reduction without compromising patient safety and outcomes has increased interest in outpatient total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). The primary aim of this study was to perform a review of the  evidence regarding the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of outpatient TSA. METHODS: A search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed using several keywords: ""outpatient,"" ""shoulder replacement,"" ""ambulatory,"" ""day case,"" ""day-case,"" ""shoulder arthroplasty,"" ""same day,"" and ""shoulder surgery."" Studies that were published from May 2010 to May 2020 in the  English language were considered. Research design, questions, and outcomes were recorded for each study. Qualitative and quantitative pooled analysis was performed on the data where appropriate. RESULTS: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Six retrospective studies compared complication rates between inpatient and outpatient cohorts and found no significant differences. Four studies found that the complication rate was lower in the outpatient cohort compared with the inpatient cohort. In a pooled analysis, the readmission rate after outpatient TSA was significantly lower than the readmission rate after inpatient TSA at 30 days (0.65% vs. 0.95%) and 90 days (2.03% vs. 2.87%) postoperatively (p < 0.05 for both). Four studies evaluated the cost of outpatient TSA in comparison with inpatient TSA. All of these studies found that  TSA at an ambulatory surgery center was significantly less costly than TSA at an  inpatient facility, both for the health-care system and for the patient. Patient  selection for outpatient TSA may depend on several important factors, including the presence or absence of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, poor functional status, higher  American Society of Anesthesiologists class, chronic narcotic use, higher body mass index, and older age. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that patient selection is the most critical factor that predicts the success of outpatient TSA. While outpatient TSA is significantly less costly than inpatient TSA, patients undergoing outpatient TSA are more likely to be healthier than patients undergoing inpatient TSA. More high-quality long-term studies are needed to add to this body of evidence. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

16,PMID:33886582,"Strategies to prevent hospital readmission and death in patients with chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Readmission following hospital discharge is common and is a major financial burden on healthcare systems. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to 1) identify studies describing post-discharge interventions and their efficacy with  respect to reducing risk of mortality and rate of hospital readmission; and 2) identify intervention characteristics associated with efficacy. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE and CINAHL. Our selection criteria included randomized controlled trials comparing post-discharge interventions with usual care on rates of hospital readmission and mortality in high-risk chronic disease patient populations. We used random effects meta-analyses to estimate pooled risk ratios  for all-cause and cause-specific mortality as well as all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization. RESULTS: We included 31 randomized controlled trials encompassing 9654 patients (24 studies in CHF, 4 in COPD, 1 in both CHF and COPD, 1 in CKD and 1 in an undifferentiated population). Meta-analysis showed post-discharge interventions reduced cause-specific (RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.63-0.80) and all cause (RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.81-0.99) hospitalization, all-cause (RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.65-0.83) and cause-specific mortality (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.54-0.84) in CHF studies, and all-cause hospitalization (RR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.32-0.83) in COPD studies. The inclusion of a cardiac nurse in the multidisciplinary team was associated with greater efficacy in reducing all-cause mortality among patients discharged after heart failure admission (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.54-0.75 vs. HR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.73-1.03). CONCLUSIONS: Post-discharge interventions reduced all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and cause-specific hospitalization in CHF patients and all-cause hospitalization in COPD patients. The presence of a cardiac nurse was associated  with greater efficacy in included studies.

Therefore, in order to provide new evidence-based medical evidence for clinical treatment, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness and safety of bisoprolol combined with  trimetazidine on CHF patients with COPD. METHODS: Seven electronic databases including Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Wanfang Data, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library will be searched in April 2021 by 2 independent reviewers. For search on PubMed, the following search terms will be used: ""trimetazidine, bisoprolol, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."" In order to achieve a consistency of extracted items, the data extractors will extract data from a sample of eligible studies. The outcomes include all-cause mortality and hospitalization for cardiac or/and respiratory causes; left ventricular structure and function; and functional scores. Review Manager software (v 5.4; Cochrane Collaboration) will be used for the meta-analysis. Two  independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias of the included studies at study level. Any disagreements will be discussed and resolved in discussion with  a third reviewer. RESULTS: The results of our review will be reported strictly following the PRISMA criteria.

We perform a meta-analysis to compare the current standard of care, redo surgical aortic valve replacement (Redo SAVR) with the less invasive alternative, valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement  (ViV TAVR) for treating structural valve deterioration. METHODS: After a comprehensive literature search, studies comparing ViV TAVR to Redo SAVR were pooled to perform a pairwise meta-analysis using the random-effects model. Primary outcomes were 30-day and follow-up mortality. RESULTS: A total of nine studies including 9127 patients were included. ViV TAVR patients were significantly older (mean difference [MD], 5.82; p = .0002) and more frequently had hypercholesterolemia (59.7 vs. 60.0%; p = .0006), coronary artery disease (16.1 vs. 16.1%; p = .04), periphery artery disease (15.4 vs. 5.7%; p = .004), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (29.3 vs. 26.2%; p = .04), renal failure (30.2 vs. 24.0%; p = .009), and >1 previous cardiac surgery (23.6 vs. 15.9%; p =  .004). Despite this, ViV TAVR was associated with decreased 30-day mortality (OR, 0.56; p < .0001). Conversely, Redo SAVR had lower 30-day paravalvular leak (OR, 6.82; p = .04), severe patient-prosthesis mismatch (OR, 3.77; p < .0001), and postoperative aortic valve gradients (MD, 5.37; p < .0001). There was no difference in follow-up mortality (HR, 1.02; p = .86). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having patients with an increased baseline risk, ViV TAVR was associated with lower 30-day mortality, while Redo SAVR had lower paravalvular leak, severe patient-prosthesis mismatch, and postoperative gradients. Although ViV TAVR remains a feasible treatment option in high-risk patients, randomized trials are  necessary to elucidate its efficacy over Redo SAVR.",10.1111/jocs.15546,"Ahmed, Adham; Levy, Kenneth H",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33797799,Journal of cardiac surgery,J Card Surg,Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Review; Systematic Review,Aortic Valve/surgery; *Aortic Valve Stenosis/surgery; *Bioprosthesis; *Heart Valve Prosthesis; *Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Reoperation; Risk Factors; *Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement; Treatment Outcome,aorta and great vessels; cardiovascular pathology; cardiovascular research; clinical review; valve repair/replacement,2021 Jul,Pubmed,API,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_API.csv
19,PMID:33653740,Does remote patient monitoring reduce acute care use? A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic diseases are associated with increased unplanned acute hospital use. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) can detect disease exacerbations and facilitate proactive management, possibly reducing expensive acute hospital usage. Current evidence examining RPM and acute care use mainly involves heart failure and omits automated invasive monitoring. This study aimed to determine if RPM reduces acute hospital use. METHODS: A systematic literature review of PubMed, Embase and CINAHL electronic databases was undertaken in July 2019 and updated in October 2020 for studies published from January 2015 to October 2020 reporting RPM and effect on hospitalisations, length of stay or emergency department presentations. All populations and disease conditions were included. Two independent reviewers screened articles. Quality analysis was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. Findings were stratified by outcome variable. Subgroup analysis was undertaken on disease condition and RPM technology. RESULTS: From 2050 identified records, 91 studies were included. Studies were medium-to-high quality. RPM for all disease conditions was reported  to reduce admissions, length of stay and emergency department presentations in 49% (n=44/90), 49% (n=23/47) and 41% (n=13/32) of studies reporting each measure, respectively. Remaining studies largely reported no change. Four studies reported RPM increased acute care use. RPM of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was more effective at reducing emergency presentation than RPM of other disease conditions. Similarly, invasive monitoring of cardiovascular disease was more effective at reducing hospital admissions versus other disease conditions and non-invasive monitoring. CONCLUSION: RPM can reduce acute care use for patients with cardiovascular disease and COPD. However, effectiveness varies within and between populations. RPM's effect on other conditions is inconclusive due to limited studies. Further analysis is required to understand underlying mechanisms causing variation in RPM interventions. These findings should be considered alongside other benefits of RPM, including increased quality of life for patients.

PURPOSE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we attempted to investigate the association between heart failure  (HF) and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and medRxiv with the search terms, ""Heart failure"" and ""COVID-19"". The  outcome of interest was mortality and poor prognosis (defined by incidence of severe COVID-19 infection, admission to ICU, and use of ventilator) in patients with preexisting heart failure with coronavirus disease. RESULTS: We identified 204 potential articles from our search, and 22 duplicates were removed. After screening of the titles and abstracts of the remaining 182 articles we identified 92 potentially relevant articles. We excluded 74 studies due to the following reasons: four studies were systematic reviews, two studies were meta-analyses, three articles were literature reviews, and 65 articles did not report on the outcome of interest. Finally, we included the remaining 18 studies in our qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis. There were 21,640 patients from 18 studies. HF was associated with hospitalization in COVID19 HR was 2.37 [1.48, 3.79; p < 0.001], high heterogeneity [I(2), 82%; p < 0.001]. HF was associated with a poor outcome demonstrated by an OR of 2.86 [2.07; 3.95; p < 0.001] high heterogeneity [I(2), 80%; p < 0.001]. Patient with preexisting HF was associated  with higher mortality OR of 3.46 [2.52, 4.75; p < 0.001] moderately high heterogeneity [I(2), 77%; p < 0.001].

We aimed to perform a comprehensive search on the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with de novo HF and ADCHF. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search on de novo/new onset acute HF vs ADCHF from inception up until December 2019. RESULTS: There were 38320 patients from 15 studies. De novo HF were younger and, had less prevalent hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and history of stroke/transient ischaemic attack compared to ADCHF. Five studies showed a lower NT-proBNP in de novo HF patients,  while one study showed no difference. Valvular heart disease as aetiology of heart failure was less frequent in de novo HF, and upon sensitivity analysis, hypertensive heart disease was more frequent in de novo HF. As for precipitating  factors, ACS (OR 2.42; I(2):89%) was more frequently seen in de novo HF, whereas  infection was less frequently (OR 0.69; I(2):32%) in ADCHF. De novo HF was associated with a significantly lower 3-month mortality (OR 0.63; I(2):91%) and 1-year (OR 0.59; I(2):59%) mortality. Meta-regression showed that 1-year mortality did not significantly vary with age (p = .106), baseline ejection fraction (p = .703), or HF reduced ejection fraction (p = .262). CONCLUSION: Risk factors, aetiology, and precipitating factors of HF in de novo and ADCHF differ.
