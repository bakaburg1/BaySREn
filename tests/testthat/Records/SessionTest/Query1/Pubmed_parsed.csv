1,PMID:32014114,"Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the  2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study.","BACKGROUND: Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak  of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have  been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to  trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic  in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside  mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health  risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention  interventions. METHODS: We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the  number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset  from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from  Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We  forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of  the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan  23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation  Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in  mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from  the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered  metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in  China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo  methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval  (CrI). FINDINGS: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive  number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95%  CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic  doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1). We estimated that in the baseline  scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461  (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139)  infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were  similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are  already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time  behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Given that 2019-nCoV  is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably  sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to  China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health  interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented  immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could  become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in  the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and  mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

2,PMID:28837555,Spread of hospital-acquired infections: A comparison of healthcare networks.,"Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), including emerging multi-drug resistant  organisms, threaten healthcare systems worldwide. Efficient containment measures of  HAIs must mobilize the entire healthcare network. Thus, to best understand how to  reduce the potential scale of HAI epidemic spread, we explore patient transfer  patterns in the French healthcare system. Using an exhaustive database of all  hospital discharge summaries in France in 2014, we construct and analyze three  patient networks based on the following: transfers of patients with HAI  (HAI-specific network); patients with suspected HAI (suspected-HAI network); and all  patients (general network). All three networks have heterogeneous patient flow and  demonstrate small-world and scale-free characteristics. Patient populations that  comprise these networks are also heterogeneous in their movement patterns. Ranking  of hospitals by centrality measures and comparing community clustering using  community detection algorithms shows that despite the differences in patient  population, the HAI-specific and suspected-HAI networks rely on the same underlying  structure as that of the general network. As a result, the general network may be  more reliable in studying potential spread of HAIs. Finally, we identify transfer  patterns at both the French regional and departmental (county) levels that are  important in the identification of key hospital centers, patient flow trajectories,  and regional clusters that may serve as a basis for novel wide-scale infection  control strategies.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005666,"Nekkab, Narimane; Astagneau, Pascal; Temime, Laura; Crépey, Pascal",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28837555,PLoS computational biology,PLoS Comput Biol,Journal Article,Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology/*methods; Cross Infection/epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission; France/epidemiology; Hospitals; Humans; Infection Control; Patient Transfer/*statistics & numerical data,NA,2017 Aug,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
3,PMID:32202401,Urology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the disease it causes,  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generating a rapid and tragic health  emergency in Italy due to the need to provide assistance to an overwhelming number  of infected patients and, at the same time, treat all the non-deferrable oncological  and benign conditions. A panel of Italian urologists has agreed on possible  strategies for the reorganization of urological routine practice and on a set of  recommendations that should facilitate the process of rescheduling both surgical and  outpatient activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the subsequent phases.  This document could be a valid tool to be used in routine clinical practice and,  possibly, a cornerstone for further discussion on the topic also considering the  further evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.

4,PMID:26336062,Transmission characteristics of MERS and SARS in the healthcare setting: a  comparative study.,"BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has caused  recurrent outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012. Although MERS has low  overall human-to-human transmission potential, there is occasional amplification in  the healthcare setting, a pattern reminiscent of the dynamics of the severe acute  respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003. Here we provide a head-to-head  comparison of exposure patterns and transmission dynamics of large hospital clusters  of MERS and SARS, including the most recent South Korean outbreak of MERS in 2015.  METHODS: To assess the unexpected nature of the recent South Korean nosocomial  outbreak of MERS and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters, we  compared exposure and transmission patterns for previously reported hospital  clusters of MERS and SARS, based on individual-level data and transmission tree  information. We carried out simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS  using branching process models rooted in transmission tree data, and inferred the  probability and characteristics of large outbreaks. RESULTS: A significant fraction  of MERS cases were linked to the healthcare setting, ranging from 43.5 % for the  nosocomial outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2014 to 100 % for both the outbreak  in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in 2013 and the outbreak in South Korea in 2015. Both MERS  and SARS nosocomial outbreaks are characterized by early nosocomial super-spreading  events, with the reproduction number dropping below 1 within three to five disease  generations. There was a systematic difference in the exposure patterns of MERS and  SARS: a majority of MERS cases occurred among patients who sought care in the same  facilities as the index case, whereas there was a greater concentration of SARS  cases among healthcare workers throughout the outbreak. Exposure patterns differed  slightly by disease generation, however, especially for SARS. Moreover, the  distributions of secondary cases per single primary case varied highly across  individual hospital outbreaks (Kruskal-Wallis test; P < 0.0001), with significantly  higher transmission heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases for MERS  than SARS. Simulations indicate a 2-fold higher probability of occurrence of large  outbreaks (>100 cases) for SARS than MERS (2 % versus 1 %); however, owing to higher  transmission heterogeneity, the largest outbreaks of MERS are characterized by  sharper incidence peaks. The probability of occurrence of MERS outbreaks larger than  the South Korean cluster (n = 186) is of the order of 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our study  suggests that the South Korean outbreak followed a similar progression to previously  described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses, with early super-spreading  events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary infections, and the  transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations. Differences in  relative exposure patterns and transmission heterogeneity of MERS and SARS could  point to changes in hospital practices since 2003 or differences in transmission  mechanisms of these coronaviruses.",10.1186/s12916-015-0450-0,"Chowell, Gerardo; Abdirizak, Fatima; Lee, Sunmi; Lee, Jonggul; Jung, Eunok; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Viboud, Cécile",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26336062,BMC medicine,BMC Med,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Aged; Coronavirus Infections/*transmission; Cross Infection/*epidemiology; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Models, Theoretical; Republic of Korea/epidemiology; Saudi Arabia/epidemiology; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome/*transmission",NA,2015 Sep 3,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
5,PMID:30858309,Incentivizing hospital infection control.,"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) pose a significant burden to patient safety.  Institutions can implement hospital infection control (HIC) measures to reduce the  impact of HAIs. Since patients can carry pathogens between institutions, there is an  economic incentive for hospitals to free ride on the HIC investments of other  facilities. Subsidies for infection control by public health authorities could  encourage regional spending on HIC. We develop coupled mathematical models of  epidemiology and hospital behavior in a game-theoretic framework to investigate how  hospitals may change spending behavior in response to subsidies. We demonstrate that  under a limited budget, a dollar-for-dollar matching grant outperforms both a  fixed-amount subsidy and a subsidy on uninfected patients in reducing the number of  HAIs in a single institution. Additionally, when multiple hospitals serve a  community, funding priority should go to the hospital with a lower transmission  rate. Overall, subsidies incentivize HIC spending and reduce the overall prevalence  of HAIs.",10.1073/pnas.1812231116,"Drohan, Sarah E; Levin, Simon A; Grenfell, Bryan T; Laxminarayan, Ramanan",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30858309,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Budgets; Cross Infection/economics/*epidemiology; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Economics, Hospital; *Game Theory; Hospital Costs; *Hospitals; Humans; *Infection Control; *Models, Theoretical; Prevalence",*antimicrobial resistance; *game theory; *nosocomial infection; *subsidy,2019 Mar 26,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
6,PMID:32327608,Spread and dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy: Effects of emergency  containment measures.,"The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy prompted drastic measures  for transmission containment. We examine the effects of these interventions, based  on modeling of the unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially  explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci  to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a metacommunity  Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes  a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the  critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a  generalized reproduction number ([Formula: see text] = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the  spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential  spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the  implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy  (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in  epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and  awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different  containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of  restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced  transmission by 45% (42 to 49%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running  scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about  200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020). Although a number of assumptions need to  be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution  of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence  exists to support the planning of emergency measures.",10.1073/pnas.2004978117,"Gatto, Marino; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Mari, Lorenzo; Miccoli, Stefano; Carraro, Luca; Casagrandi, Renato; Rinaldo, Andrea",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327608,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Video-Audio Media","Basic Reproduction Number; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control/*methods; Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Italy/epidemiology; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics/*prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission; SARS-CoV-2",*SARS-CoV-2; *SEIR models; *disease outbreak scenarios; *social contact restrictions; *spatially explicit epidemiology,2020 May 12,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
7,PMID:28951015,Effectiveness of an ultraviolet-C disinfection system for reduction of  healthcare-associated pathogens.,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR)  pathogens are significantly associated with increased mortality and morbidity.  Environmental cleaning can reduce transmission of these pathogens but is often  inadequate. Adjunctive methods are warranted to enhance the effectiveness of  disinfection particularly in hospital settings where healthcare-associated  infections are of major concern. METHODS: We conducted a study to examine the  effectiveness of a mobile, automatic device, Hyper Light Disinfection Robot (model:  Hyper Light P3), which utilized ultraviolet-C (UV-C) to kill MDR-Pseudomonas  aeruginosa, MDR- Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), Mycobacterium  abscessus and Aspergillus fumigatus. The performance of this device in disinfecting  hospital rooms previously admitted by patients harboring MRSA and VRE was also  assessed. RESULTS: Except for VRE and M. abscessus, more than 3 log(10) reduction of  vegetative bacteria colonies was observed after UV-C irradiation of 5 min at a  distance of 3 m from the device. At the distance of 1 m, substantial and comparable  reduction of colonies was observed across all tested microorganisms regardless of  exposure time. The killing effect was less pronounced for A. fumigatus particularly  at the distance of 2-3 m. In uncleaned hospital rooms, there was significant  reduction in the number of bacteria colonies sampled from different surfaces after  UV-C irradiation for 15 min. CONCLUSIONS: UV-C disinfection system was effective in  killing MDR pathogens.

8,PMID:31631371,Analysis of network interventions with an application to hospital-acquired  infections.,"Regional interventions to prevent the spread of hospital-acquired infections,  vaccination campaigns, and information dissemination strategies are examples of  treatment interventions applied to members of a network with the intent of effecting  a network-wide change. In designing clinical trials or determining policy changes,  it may not be cost effective or otherwise possible to treat all actors of a network.  There is a notable lack of study designs and statistical frameworks with which to  plan a network-wide intervention in this context and analyze the resulting data.  This paper builds off of the network autocorrelation model in order to provide such  a framework for a pre-post study design. We derive key quantitative measures of the  network-wide treatment effect, exact formulas for power analyses of these measures,  and extensions for the context in which the network is unknown. As the treatment  assignation is part of the network-wide treatment, we provide methods for  determining the assignation which optimizes the overall treatment effect over all  members of the network subject to any arbitrary set of implementation costs and cost  constraint. We implement these methods on Clostridioides difficile data for the  state of California, where the hospitals are linked through patient sharing.",10.1002/sim.8373,"Sewell, Daniel K",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31631371,Statistics in medicine,Stat Med,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Bayes Theorem; Biostatistics; California/epidemiology; Clostridioides difficile; Clostridium Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control; Computer Simulation; Cross Infection/*prevention & control/therapy/transmission; Humans; Information Services; Likelihood Functions; Models, Statistical; Outcome Assessment, Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Treatment Outcome",*infectious disease; *network autocorrelation model; *optimization; *power analyses; *study design,2019 Dec 10,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
9,PMID:31862167,Simulation models for transmission of health care-associated infection: A systematic  review.,"BACKGROUND: Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are a global health burden  because of their significant impact on patient health and health care systems.  Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients,  pathogens, and the environment is increasingly being used to improve understanding  of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on infection  prevention and control (IPC). The purpose of this review is to present a systematic  review to establish (1) how simulation models have been used to investigate HAIs and  their mitigation and (2) how these models have evolved over time, as well as  identify (3) gaps in their adoption and (4) useful directions for their future  development. METHODS: The review involved a systematic search and identification of  studies using system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based model to  study HAIs. RESULTS: The complexity of simulation models developed for HAIs  significantly increased but heavily concentrated on transmission dynamics of  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the hospitals of high-income  countries. Neither HAIs in other health care settings, the influence of contact  networks within a health care facility, nor patient sharing and referring networks  across health care settings were sufficiently understood.

We noted that, while social distancing interventions were in place,  most new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were averted, even with modest  reductions in contact among adults. However, when interventions ended, the epidemic  rebounded.

12,PMID:30919885,Modeling Regional Transmission and Containment of a Healthcare-associated  Multidrug-resistant Organism.,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published  interim guidance for a public health response to contain novel or targeted  multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). We assessed the impact of implementing the  strategy in a US state using a mathematical model. METHODS: We used a deterministic  compartmental model, parametrized via a novel analysis of carbapenem-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network and  patient transfer data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The  simulations assumed that after the importation of the MDRO and its initial detection  by clinical culture at an index hospital, fortnightly prevalence surveys for  colonization and additional infection control interventions were implemented at the  index facility; similar surveys were then also implemented at those facilities known  to be connected most strongly to it as measured by patient transfer data; and  prevalence surveys were discontinued after 2 consecutive negative surveys. RESULTS:  If additional infection-control interventions are assumed to lead to a 20% reduction  in transmissibility in intervention facilities, prevalent case count in the state 3  years after importation would be reduced by 76% (interquartile range: 73-77%).  During the third year, these additional infection-control measures would be applied  in facilities accounting for 42% (37-46%) of inpatient days. CONCLUSIONS: CDC  guidance for containing MDROs, when used in combination with information on transfer  of patients among hospitals, is predicted to be effective, enabling targeted and  efficient use of prevention resources during an outbreak response.

13,PMID:31089148,Comparative Analysis of Eleven Healthcare-Associated Outbreaks of Middle East  Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Mers-Cov) from 2015 to 2017.,"Since its emergence in 2012, 2,260 cases and 803 deaths due to Middle East  respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health  Organization. Most cases were due to transmission in healthcare settings, sometimes  causing large outbreaks. We analyzed epidemiologic and clinical data of  laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from eleven healthcare-associated outbreaks in  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015-2017. We  quantified key epidemiological differences between outbreaks. Twenty-five percent  (n = 105/422) of MERS cases who acquired infection in a hospital setting were  healthcare personnel. In multivariate analyses, age ≥65 (OR 4.8, 95%CI: 2.6-8.7) and  the presence of underlying comorbidities (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.7) were associated  with increased mortality whereas working as healthcare personnel was protective (OR  0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.34).

14,PMID:31287832,Modeling household dynamics on Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of respiratory tract  infection in infants and children and shows increasing trend among elderly people  worldwide. In many developing country settings, population and household structures  have gone through some significant changes in the past decades, namely fewer births,  more elderly population, and smaller household size but more RSV high-risk  individuals. These dynamics have been captured in a mathematical model with RSV  transmission dynamics to predict the disease burden on the detailed population for  future targeted interventions. The population and disease dynamics model was  constructed and tested against the hospitalization data for Acute Lower Respiratory  Tract Infection due to RSV in rural Thai settings between 2005 and 2011. The  proportion of extended families is predicted to increase by about 10% from 2005 to  2020, especially for those with elderly population, while the classic nuclear family  type (with adults and children) will decline by about 10%. For RSV, infections from  extended family type (approximately 60% of all household types) have majorly  contributed to the force of infection (FOI). While the model predicted the increase  of FOI from the extended family by 15% from 2005 to 2020, the FOI contributed by  other household types would be either stable or decrease in the same time period.  RSV incidence rate is predominantly high among babies (92.2%) and has been predicted  to decrease slightly over time (from 940 to 864 cases per 100,000 population by  2020), while the incidence rates among children and elderly people may remain  steadily low over the same period. However, the estimated incidence rates among  elderly people were twice than those in children. The model predicts that  approximately 60% of FOI for RSV will come from members of the extended family type.  The incidence rate of RSV among children and elderly in extended families was about  20 times lower than that in infants and the trend is steady. Targeted intervention  strategies, such as health education in some specific groups and targeted  vaccination, may be considered, with the focus on extended family type. Target  interventions on babies can lessen the transmission to children and elderly  especially when transmission within households of extended family type is high.",10.1371/journal.pone.0219323,"Mahikul, Wiriya; J White, Lisa; Poovorawan, Kittiyod; Soonthornworasiri, Ngamphol; Sukontamarn, Pataporn; Chanthavilay, Phetsavanh; F Medley, Graham; Pan-Ngum, Wirichada",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31287832,PloS one,PLoS One,"Historical Article; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; History, 21st Century; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; *Models, Theoretical; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/*epidemiology/history/transmission/virology; *Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human/physiology; Seasons; Thailand/epidemiology; Young Adult",NA,2019,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
15,PMID:24980276,Risk factors for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection  among rectal carriers: a prospective observational multicentre study.,"Knowledge of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) colonization is  important to prevent nosocomial spread but also to start prompt adequate antibiotic  therapy in patients with suspicion of infection. However, few studies have examined  the incidence and risk factors for CR-KP bloodstream infection (BSI) among rectal  carriers. To identify risk factors for CR-KP BSI among carriers, we performed a  multicentre prospective matched case-control study of all adult CR-KP rectal  carriers hospitalized in five tertiary teaching hospitals in Italy over a 2-year  period. Carriers who developed CR-KP BSI were compared with those who did not  develop subsequent BSI. Overall, 143 CR-KP BSIs were compared with 572 controls  without a documented infection during their hospitalization. Multivariate analysis  revealed that admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (OR, 1.65; 95% CI,  1.05-2.59; p 0.03), abdominal invasive procedure (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.16-3.04;  p 0.01), chemotherapy/radiation therapy (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.78-5.29; p <0.0001),  and number of additional colonization sites (OR, 3.37 per site; 95% CI, 2.56-4.43;  p <0.0001) were independent risk factors for CR-KP BSI development among CR-KP  rectal carriers. A CR-KP BSI risk score ranging from 0 to 28 was developed based on  these four independent variables. At a cut-off of ≥2 the model exhibited a  sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of  93%, 42%, 29% and 93%, respectively. Colonization at multiple sites with CR-KP was  the strongest predictor of BSI development in our large cohort of CR-KP rectal  carriers.",10.1111/1469-0691.12747,"Giannella, M; Trecarichi, E M; De Rosa, F G; Del Bono, V; Bassetti, M; Lewis, R E; Losito, A R; Corcione, S; Saffioti, C; Bartoletti, M; Maiuro, G; Cardellino, C S; Tedeschi, S; Cauda, R; Viscoli, C; Viale, P; Tumbarello, M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24980276,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European  Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,Clin Microbiol Infect,Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Observational Study,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology; Carbapenems/*pharmacology; Carrier State/*epidemiology/microbiology; Case-Control Studies; Female; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Incidence; Italy/epidemiology; Klebsiella Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology; Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/isolation & purification; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Rectum/*microbiology; Risk Factors; Tertiary Care Centers; Young Adult; *beta-Lactam Resistance",Bloodstream infection; carbapenem resistance; colonization status; rectal carriers,2014 Dec,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
16,PMID:20148749,Quantitative evaluation of infection control models in the prevention of nosocomial  transmission of SARS virus to healthcare workers: implication to nosocomial viral  infection control for healthcare workers.,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring emerging infections while  caring for patients, as has been shown in the recent SARS and swine flu epidemics.  Using SARS as an example, we determined the effectiveness of infection control  measures (ICMs) by logistic regression and structural equation modelling (SEM), a  quantitative methodology that can test a hypothetical model and validates causal  relationships among ICMs. Logistic regression showed that installing hand wash  stations in the emergency room (p = 0.012, odds ratio = 1.07) was the only ICM  significantly associated with the protection of HCWs from acquiring the SARS virus.  The structural equation modelling results showed that the most important  contributing factor (highest proportion of effectiveness) was installation of a  fever screening station outside the emergency department (51%). Other measures  included traffic control in the emergency department (19%), availability of an  outbreak standard operation protocol (12%), mandatory temperature screening (9%),  establishing a hand washing setup at each hospital checkpoint (3%), adding  simplified isolation rooms (3%), and a standardized patient transfer protocol (3%).  Installation of fever screening stations outside of the hospital and implementing  traffic control in the emergency department contributed to 70% of the effectiveness  in the prevention of SARS transmission. Our approach can be applied to the  evaluation of control measures for other epidemic infectious diseases, including  swine flu and avian flu.",10.3109/00365540903582400,"Yen, Muh-Yong; Lu, Yun-Ching; Huang, Pi-Hsiang; Chen, Chen-Ming; Chen, Yee-Chun; Lin, Yusen E",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20148749,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,Scand J Infect Dis,Journal Article,"Cross Infection/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Disease Outbreaks/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data; Health Personnel/statistics & numerical data; Humans; *Infection Control/methods/standards; Logistic Models; Models, Biological; *Models, Statistical; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Time Factors",NA,2010 Jul,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
17,PMID:32077650,Systems Modeling Approach for Reducing the Risk of Healthcare-Associated Infections.,"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a major cause of concern because of the  high levels of associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. In addition, children and  intensive care unit (ICU) patients are more vulnerable to these infections due to  low levels of immunity. Various medical interventions and statistical process  control techniques have been suggested to counter the spread of these infections and  aid early detection of an infection outbreak. Methods such as hand hygiene help in  the prevention of HAIs and are well-documented in the literature. This chapter  demonstrates the utilization of a systems methodology to model and validate factors  that contribute to the risk of HAIs in a pediatric ICU. It proposes an approach that  has three unique aspects: it studies the problem of HAIs as a whole by focusing on  several HAIs instead of a single type, it projects the effects of interventions onto  the general patient population using the system-level model, and it studies both  medical and behavioral interventions and compares their effectiveness. This  methodology uses a systems modeling framework that includes simulation, risk  analysis, and statistical techniques for studying interventions to reduce the  transmission likelihood of HAIs.",10.1108/S1474-823120190000018013,"Limaye, Shreyas S; Mastrangelo, Christina M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32077650,Advances in health care management,Adv Health Care Manag,Journal Article,"Child; *Cross Infection; Disease Outbreaks; *Hand Hygiene; Humans; Infection Control; Intensive Care Units, Pediatric; *Systems Analysis",Healthcare-associated infections; experimental design; mixture design experiments; risk modeling; simulation optimization; systems engineering approach,2019 Oct 24,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
18,PMID:32690354,Role of modelling in COVID-19 policy development.,"Models have played an important role in policy development to address the COVID-19  outbreak from its emergence in China to the current global pandemic. Early  projections of international spread influenced travel restrictions and border  closures. Model projections based on the virus's infectiousness demonstrated its  pandemic potential, which guided the global response to and prepared countries for  increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Tracking the impact of distancing and  movement policies and behaviour changes has been critical in evaluating these  decisions. Models have provided insights into the epidemiological differences  between higher and lower income countries, as well as vulnerable population groups  within countries to help design fit-for-purpose policies. Economic evaluation and  policies have combined epidemic models and traditional economic models to address  the economic consequences of COVID-19, which have informed policy calls for easing  restrictions. Social contact and mobility models have allowed evaluation of the  pathways to safely relax mobility restrictions and distancing measures. Finally,  models can consider future end-game scenarios, including how suppression can be  achieved and the impact of different vaccination strategies.",10.1016/j.prrv.2020.06.013,"McBryde, Emma S; Meehan, Michael T; Adegboye, Oyelola A; Adekunle, Adeshina I; Caldwell, Jamie M; Pak, Anton; Rojas, Diana P; Williams, Bridget M; Trauer, James M",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32690354,Paediatric respiratory reviews,Paediatr Respir Rev,Journal Article; Review,"Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission; Developing Countries; Epidemiologic Methods; *Health Policy; Humans; Models, Economic; *Models, Theoretical; Pandemics/prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission; *Policy Making; Public Health; Public Policy; SARS-CoV-2; Travel; Viral Vaccines/therapeutic use",COVID-19; Emerging infectious diseases; Mathematical modelling; Pandemic; Public health policy,2020 Sep,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
19,PMID:30880267,Seasonality and community interventions in a mathematical model of Clostridium  difficile transmission.,"BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of  antibiotic-associated diarrhoea with peak incidence in late winter or early autumn.  Although CDI is commonly associated with hospitals, community transmission is  important. AIM: To explore potential drivers of CDI seasonality and the effect of  community-based interventions to reduce transmission. METHODS: A mechanistic  compartmental model of C. difficile transmission in a hospital and surrounding  community was used to determine the effect of reducing transmission or antibiotic  prescriptions in these settings. The model was extended to allow for seasonal  antibiotic prescriptions and seasonal transmission. FINDINGS: Modelling antibiotic  seasonality reproduced the seasonality of CDI, including approximate magnitude  (13.9-15.1% above annual mean) and timing of peaks (0.7-1.0 months after peak  antibiotics). Halving seasonal excess prescriptions reduced the incidence of CDI by  6-18%. Seasonal transmission produced larger seasonal peaks in the prevalence of  community colonization (14.8-22.1% above mean) than seasonal antibiotic  prescriptions (0.2-1.7% above mean). Reducing transmission from symptomatic or  hospitalized patients had little effect on community-acquired CDI, but reducing  transmission in the community by ≥7% or transmission from infants by ≥30% eliminated  the pathogen. Reducing antibiotic prescription rates led to approximately  proportional reductions in infections, but limited reductions in the prevalence of  colonization. CONCLUSION: Seasonal variation in antibiotic prescription rates can  account for the observed magnitude and timing of C. difficile seasonality. Even  complete prevention of transmission from hospitalized patients or symptomatic  patients cannot eliminate the pathogen, but interventions to reduce transmission  from community residents or infants could have a large impact on both hospital- and  community-acquired infections.",10.1016/j.jhin.2019.03.001,"McLure, A; Furuya-Kanamori, L; Clements, A C A; Kirk, M; Glass, K",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30880267,The Journal of hospital infection,J Hosp Infect,Journal Article,"Adult; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use; Clostridium Infections/*prevention & control/*transmission; Disease Transmission, Infectious/*prevention & control; *Drug Utilization; Humans; Infant; Infection Control/*methods; *Models, Theoretical; Prescriptions/statistics & numerical data; Prevalence; Seasons",Clostridium difficile; Community-acquired infections; Hospital-acquired infections; Mathematical model; Seasonal infections,2019 Jun,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
20,PMID:32735581,A data-driven model to describe and forecast the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission.,"This paper proposes a dynamic model to describe and forecast the dynamics of the  coronavirus disease COVID-19 transmission. The model is based on an approach  previously used to describe the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic.  This methodology is used to describe the COVID-19 dynamics in six countries where  the pandemic is widely spread, namely China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the  USA. For this purpose, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and  Control (ECDC) are adopted. It is shown how the model can be used to forecast new  infection cases and new deceased and how the uncertainties associated to this  prediction can be quantified. This approach has the advantage of being relatively  simple, grouping in few mathematical parameters the many conditions which affect the  spreading of the disease. On the other hand, it requires previous data from the  disease transmission in the country, being better suited for regions where the  epidemic is not at a very early stage. With the estimated parameters at hand, one  can use the model to predict the evolution of the disease, which in turn enables  authorities to plan their actions. Moreover, one key advantage is the  straightforward interpretation of these parameters and their influence over the  evolution of the disease, which enables altering some of them, so that one can  evaluate the effect of public policy, such as social distancing. The results  presented for the selected countries confirm the accuracy to perform predictions.",10.1371/journal.pone.0236386,"Paiva, Henrique Mohallem; Afonso, Rubens Junqueira Magalhães; de Oliveira, Igor Luppi; Garcia, Gabriele Fernandes",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32735581,PloS one,PLoS One,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Asymptomatic Diseases; *Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China/epidemiology; Community-Acquired Infections; Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology/mortality/*transmission/virology; Cross Infection; Data Accuracy; Europe/epidemiology; Forecasting/*methods; Hospitalization; Humans; *Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology/mortality/*transmission/virology; SARS-CoV-2; United States/epidemiology",NA,2020,Pubmed,parsed,2022-01-14T10:13:14Z,SessionTest/Query1/Pubmed_parsed.csv
