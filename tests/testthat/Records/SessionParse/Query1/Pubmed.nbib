AB  - BACKGROUND: Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak 
      of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have 
      been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to 
      trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic 
      in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside 
      mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health 
      risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention 
      interventions. METHODS: We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the 
      number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset 
      from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from 
      Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We 
      forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of 
      the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 
      23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation 
      Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in 
      mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from 
      the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 
      Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered 
      metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in 
      China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
      methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval 
      (CrI). FINDINGS: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive 
      number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% 
      CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic 
      doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1). We estimated that in the baseline 
      scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 
      (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) 
      infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were 
      similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are 
      already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time 
      behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Given that 2019-nCoV 
      is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably 
      sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to 
      China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health 
      interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented 
      immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could 
      become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in 
      the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and 
      mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally. FUNDING:

PG  - e1005666

AB  - Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), including emerging multi-drug resistant 
      organisms, threaten healthcare systems worldwide. Efficient containment measures of 
      HAIs must mobilize the entire healthcare network. Thus, to best understand how to 
      reduce the potential scale of HAI epidemic spread, we explore patient transfer 
      patterns in the French healthcare system. Using an exhaustive database of all 
      hospital discharge summaries in France in 2014, we construct and analyze three 
      patient networks based on the following: transfers of patients with HAI 
      (HAI-specific network); patients with suspected HAI (suspected-HAI network); and all 
      patients (general network). All three networks have heterogeneous patient flow and 
      demonstrate small-world and scale-free characteristics. Patient populations that 
      comprise these networks are also heterogeneous in their movement patterns. Ranking 
      of hospitals by centrality measures and comparing community clustering using 
      community detection algorithms shows that despite the differences in patient 
      population, the HAI-specific and suspected-HAI networks rely on the same underlying 
      structure as that of the general network. As a result, the general network may be 
      more reliable in studying potential spread of HAIs. Finally, we identify transfer 
      patterns at both the French regional and departmental (county) levels that are 
      important in the identification of key hospital centers, patient flow trajectories, 
      and regional clusters that may serve as a basis for novel wide-scale infection 
      control strategies.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the disease it causes, 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generating a rapid and tragic health 
      emergency in Italy due to the need to provide assistance to an overwhelming number 
      of infected patients and, at the same time, treat all the non-deferrable oncological 
      and benign conditions. A panel of Italian urologists has agreed on possible 
      strategies for the reorganization of urological routine practice and on a set of 
      recommendations that should facilitate the process of rescheduling both surgical and 
      outpatient activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the subsequent phases. 
      This document could be a valid tool to be used in routine clinical practice and, 
      possibly, a cornerstone for further discussion on the topic also considering the 
      further evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also may provide useful 
      recommendations for national and international urological societies in a condition 
      of emergency.

      comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has caused 
      recurrent outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012. Although MERS has low 
      overall human-to-human transmission potential, there is occasional amplification in 
      the healthcare setting, a pattern reminiscent of the dynamics of the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003. Here we provide a head-to-head 
      comparison of exposure patterns and transmission dynamics of large hospital clusters 
      of MERS and SARS, including the most recent South Korean outbreak of MERS in 2015. 
      METHODS: To assess the unexpected nature of the recent South Korean nosocomial 
      outbreak of MERS and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters, we 
      compared exposure and transmission patterns for previously reported hospital 
      clusters of MERS and SARS, based on individual-level data and transmission tree 
      information. We carried out simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS 
      using branching process models rooted in transmission tree data, and inferred the 
      probability and characteristics of large outbreaks. RESULTS: A significant fraction 
      of MERS cases were linked to the healthcare setting, ranging from 43.5 % for the 
      nosocomial outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2014 to 100 % for both the outbreak 
      in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in 2013 and the outbreak in South Korea in 2015. Both MERS 
      and SARS nosocomial outbreaks are characterized by early nosocomial super-spreading 
      events, with the reproduction number dropping below 1 within three to five disease 
      generations. There was a systematic difference in the exposure patterns of MERS and 
      SARS: a majority of MERS cases occurred among patients who sought care in the same 
      facilities as the index case, whereas there was a greater concentration of SARS 
      cases among healthcare workers throughout the outbreak. Exposure patterns differed 
      slightly by disease generation, however, especially for SARS. Moreover, the 
      distributions of secondary cases per single primary case varied highly across 
      individual hospital outbreaks (Kruskal-Wallis test; P < 0.0001), with significantly 
      higher transmission heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases for MERS 
      than SARS. Simulations indicate a 2-fold higher probability of occurrence of large 
      outbreaks (>100 cases) for SARS than MERS (2 % versus 1 %); however, owing to higher 
      transmission heterogeneity, the largest outbreaks of MERS are characterized by 
      sharper incidence peaks. The probability of occurrence of MERS outbreaks larger than 
      the South Korean cluster (n = 186) is of the order of 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      suggests that the South Korean outbreak followed a similar progression to previously 
      described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses, with early super-spreading 
      events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary infections, and the 
      transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations. Differences in 
      relative exposure patterns and transmission heterogeneity of MERS and SARS could 
      point to changes in hospital practices since 2003 or differences in transmission 
      mechanisms of these coronaviruses.

AB  - Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) pose a significant burden to patient safety. 
      Institutions can implement hospital infection control (HIC) measures to reduce the 
      impact of HAIs. Since patients can carry pathogens between institutions, there is an 
      economic incentive for hospitals to free ride on the HIC investments of other 
      facilities. Subsidies for infection control by public health authorities could 
      encourage regional spending on HIC. We develop coupled mathematical models of 
      epidemiology and hospital behavior in a game-theoretic framework to investigate how 
      hospitals may change spending behavior in response to subsidies. We demonstrate that 
      under a limited budget, a dollar-for-dollar matching grant outperforms both a 
      fixed-amount subsidy and a subsidy on uninfected patients in reducing the number of 
      HAIs in a single institution. Additionally, when multiple hospitals serve a 
      community, funding priority should go to the hospital with a lower transmission 
      rate. Overall, subsidies incentivize HIC spending and reduce the overall prevalence 
      of HAIs.

TI  - Spread and dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy: Effects of emergency 
      containment measures.
PG  - 10484-10491
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2004978117 [doi]
AB  - The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy prompted drastic measures 
      for transmission containment. We examine the effects of these interventions, based 
      on modeling of the unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially 
      explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci 
      to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a metacommunity 
      Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes 
      a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the 
      critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a 
      generalized reproduction number ([Formula: see text] = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the 
      spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential 
      spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the 
      implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy 
      (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in 
      epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and 
      awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different 
      containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of 
      restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced 
      transmission by 45% (42 to 49%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running 
      scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 
      200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020). Although a number of assumptions need to 
      be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution 
      of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence 
      exists to support the planning of emergency measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
      pathogens are significantly associated with increased mortality and morbidity. 
      Environmental cleaning can reduce transmission of these pathogens but is often 
      inadequate. Adjunctive methods are warranted to enhance the effectiveness of 
      disinfection particularly in hospital settings where healthcare-associated 
      infections are of major concern. METHODS: We conducted a study to examine the 
      effectiveness of a mobile, automatic device, Hyper Light Disinfection Robot (model: 
      Hyper Light P3), which utilized ultraviolet-C (UV-C) to kill MDR-Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa, MDR- Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), Mycobacterium 
      abscessus and Aspergillus fumigatus. The performance of this device in disinfecting 
      hospital rooms previously admitted by patients harboring MRSA and VRE was also 
      assessed. RESULTS: Except for VRE and M. abscessus, more than 3 log(10) reduction of 
      vegetative bacteria colonies was observed after UV-C irradiation of 5 min at a 
      distance of 3 m from the device. At the distance of 1 m, substantial and comparable 
      reduction of colonies was observed across all tested microorganisms regardless of 
      exposure time. The killing effect was less pronounced for A. fumigatus particularly 
      at the distance of 2-3 m. In uncleaned hospital rooms, there was significant 
      reduction in the number of bacteria colonies sampled from different surfaces after 
      UV-C irradiation for 15 min. CONCLUSIONS: UV-C disinfection system was effective in 
      killing MDR pathogens. Further study is warranted to confirm its effectiveness as an 
      adjunctive method in disinfecting hospital environment.

AB  - Regional interventions to prevent the spread of hospital-acquired infections, 
      vaccination campaigns, and information dissemination strategies are examples of 
      treatment interventions applied to members of a network with the intent of effecting 
      a network-wide change. In designing clinical trials or determining policy changes, 
      it may not be cost effective or otherwise possible to treat all actors of a network. 
      There is a notable lack of study designs and statistical frameworks with which to 
      plan a network-wide intervention in this context and analyze the resulting data. 
      This paper builds off of the network autocorrelation model in order to provide such 
      a framework for a pre-post study design. We derive key quantitative measures of the 
      network-wide treatment effect, exact formulas for power analyses of these measures, 
      and extensions for the context in which the network is unknown. As the treatment 
      assignation is part of the network-wide treatment, we provide methods for 
      determining the assignation which optimizes the overall treatment effect over all 
      members of the network subject to any arbitrary set of implementation costs and cost 
      constraint. We implement these methods on Clostridioides difficile data for the 
      state of California, where the hospitals are linked through patient sharing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are a global health burden 
      because of their significant impact on patient health and health care systems. 
      Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients, 
      pathogens, and the environment is increasingly being used to improve understanding 
      of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on infection 
      prevention and control (IPC). The purpose of this review is to present a systematic 
      review to establish (1) how simulation models have been used to investigate HAIs and 
      their mitigation and (2) how these models have evolved over time, as well as 
      identify (3) gaps in their adoption and (4) useful directions for their future 
      development. METHODS: The review involved a systematic search and identification of 
      studies using system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based model to 
      study HAIs. RESULTS: The complexity of simulation models developed for HAIs 
      significantly increased but heavily concentrated on transmission dynamics of 
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the hospitals of high-income 
      countries. Neither HAIs in other health care settings, the influence of contact 
      networks within a health care facility, nor patient sharing and referring networks 
      across health care settings were sufficiently understood. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      systematic review provides a broader overview of existing simulation models in HAIs 
      to identify the gaps and to direct and facilitate further development of appropriate 
      models in this emerging field.

TI  - The SIS model with diffusion of virus in the environment.
PG  - 2852-2874
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2019141 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we propose an SIS-type reaction-diffusion equations, which contains 
      both direct transmission and indirect transmission via free-living and spatially 
      diffusive bacteria/virus in the contaminated environment, motivated by the dynamics 
      of hospital infections. We establish the basic reproduction number R₀ which can act 
      as threshold level to determine whether the disease persists or not. In particular, 
      if R₀<1 then="" the="" disease-free="" equilibrium="" is="" globally="" 
      asymptotically="" stable="" whereas="". For the spatially homogeneous system, we 
      investigate the traveling wave solutions and obtain that there exists a critical 
      wave speed, below which there has no traveling waves, above which the traveling wave 
      solutions may exist for small diffusion coefficient by the geometric singular 
      perturbation method. The finding implies that great spatial transmission leads to an 
      increase in new infection, while large diffusion of bacteria/virus results in the 
      new infection decline for spatially heterogeneous environment.

AB  - By April 2, 2020, >1 million persons worldwide were infected with severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We used a mathematical model to investigate the 
      effectiveness of social distancing interventions in a mid-sized city. Interventions 
      reduced contacts of adults >60 years of age, adults 20-59 years of age, and children 
      <19 years of age for 6 weeks. Our results suggest interventions started earlier in 
      the epidemic delay the epidemic curve and interventions started later flatten the 
      epidemic curve. We noted that, while social distancing interventions were in place, 
      most new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were averted, even with modest 
      reductions in contact among adults. However, when interventions ended, the epidemic 
      rebounded. Our models suggest that social distancing can provide crucial time to 
      increase healthcare capacity but must occur in conjunction with testing and contact 
      tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate virus transmission.

LID - ciz248
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published 
      interim guidance for a public health response to contain novel or targeted 
      multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). We assessed the impact of implementing the 
      strategy in a US state using a mathematical model. METHODS: We used a deterministic 
      compartmental model, parametrized via a novel analysis of carbapenem-resistant 
      Enterobacteriaceae data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network and 
      patient transfer data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The 
      simulations assumed that after the importation of the MDRO and its initial detection 
      by clinical culture at an index hospital, fortnightly prevalence surveys for 
      colonization and additional infection control interventions were implemented at the 
      index facility; similar surveys were then also implemented at those facilities known 
      to be connected most strongly to it as measured by patient transfer data; and 
      prevalence surveys were discontinued after 2 consecutive negative surveys. RESULTS: 
      If additional infection-control interventions are assumed to lead to a 20% reduction 
      in transmissibility in intervention facilities, prevalent case count in the state 3 
      years after importation would be reduced by 76% (interquartile range: 73-77%). 
      During the third year, these additional infection-control measures would be applied 
      in facilities accounting for 42% (37-46%) of inpatient days. CONCLUSIONS: CDC 
      guidance for containing MDROs, when used in combination with information on transfer 
      of patients among hospitals, is predicted to be effective, enabling targeted and 
      efficient use of prevention resources during an outbreak response. Even modestly 
      effective infection-control measures may lead to a substantial reduction in 
      transmission events.

AB  - Since its emergence in 2012, 2,260 cases and 803 deaths due to Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health 
      Organization. Most cases were due to transmission in healthcare settings, sometimes 
      causing large outbreaks. We analyzed epidemiologic and clinical data of 
      laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from eleven healthcare-associated outbreaks in 
      the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015-2017. We 
      quantified key epidemiological differences between outbreaks. Twenty-five percent 
      (n = 105/422) of MERS cases who acquired infection in a hospital setting were 
      healthcare personnel. In multivariate analyses, age ≥65 (OR 4.8, 95%CI: 2.6-8.7) and 
      the presence of underlying comorbidities (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.7) were associated 
      with increased mortality whereas working as healthcare personnel was protective (OR 
      0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.34). At the start of these outbreaks, the reproduction number 
      ranged from 1.0 to 5.7; it dropped below 1 within 2 to 6 weeks. This study provides 
      a comprehensive characterization of MERS HCA-outbreaks. Our results highlight 
      heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile of healthcare-associated outbreaks. 
      The limitations of our study stress the urgent need for standardized data collection 
      for high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV.

LID - e0219323
AB  - Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of respiratory tract 
      infection in infants and children and shows increasing trend among elderly people 
      worldwide. In many developing country settings, population and household structures 
      have gone through some significant changes in the past decades, namely fewer births, 
      more elderly population, and smaller household size but more RSV high-risk 
      individuals. These dynamics have been captured in a mathematical model with RSV 
      transmission dynamics to predict the disease burden on the detailed population for 
      future targeted interventions. The population and disease dynamics model was 
      constructed and tested against the hospitalization data for Acute Lower Respiratory 
      Tract Infection due to RSV in rural Thai settings between 2005 and 2011. The 
      proportion of extended families is predicted to increase by about 10% from 2005 to 
      2020, especially for those with elderly population, while the classic nuclear family 
      type (with adults and children) will decline by about 10%. For RSV, infections from 
      extended family type (approximately 60% of all household types) have majorly 
      contributed to the force of infection (FOI). While the model predicted the increase 
      of FOI from the extended family by 15% from 2005 to 2020, the FOI contributed by 
      other household types would be either stable or decrease in the same time period. 
      RSV incidence rate is predominantly high among babies (92.2%) and has been predicted 
      to decrease slightly over time (from 940 to 864 cases per 100,000 population by 
      2020), while the incidence rates among children and elderly people may remain 
      steadily low over the same period. However, the estimated incidence rates among 
      elderly people were twice than those in children. The model predicts that 
      approximately 60% of FOI for RSV will come from members of the extended family type. 
      The incidence rate of RSV among children and elderly in extended families was about 
      20 times lower than that in infants and the trend is steady. Targeted intervention 
      strategies, such as health education in some specific groups and targeted 
      vaccination, may be considered, with the focus on extended family type. Target 
      interventions on babies can lessen the transmission to children and elderly 
      especially when transmission within households of extended family type is high.

AB  - Knowledge of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) colonization is 
      important to prevent nosocomial spread but also to start prompt adequate antibiotic 
      therapy in patients with suspicion of infection. However, few studies have examined 
      the incidence and risk factors for CR-KP bloodstream infection (BSI) among rectal 
      carriers. To identify risk factors for CR-KP BSI among carriers, we performed a 
      multicentre prospective matched case-control study of all adult CR-KP rectal 
      carriers hospitalized in five tertiary teaching hospitals in Italy over a 2-year 
      period. Carriers who developed CR-KP BSI were compared with those who did not 
      develop subsequent BSI. Overall, 143 CR-KP BSIs were compared with 572 controls 
      without a documented infection during their hospitalization. Multivariate analysis 
      revealed that admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 
      1.05-2.59; p 0.03), abdominal invasive procedure (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.16-3.04; 
      p 0.01), chemotherapy/radiation therapy (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.78-5.29; p <0.0001), 
      and number of additional colonization sites (OR, 3.37 per site; 95% CI, 2.56-4.43; 
      p <0.0001) were independent risk factors for CR-KP BSI development among CR-KP 
      rectal carriers. A CR-KP BSI risk score ranging from 0 to 28 was developed based on 
      these four independent variables. At a cut-off of ≥2 the model exhibited a 
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 
      93%, 42%, 29% and 93%, respectively. Colonization at multiple sites with CR-KP was 
      the strongest predictor of BSI development in our large cohort of CR-KP rectal 
      carriers.

AB  - Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring emerging infections while 
      caring for patients, as has been shown in the recent SARS and swine flu epidemics. 
      Using SARS as an example, we determined the effectiveness of infection control 
      measures (ICMs) by logistic regression and structural equation modelling (SEM), a 
      quantitative methodology that can test a hypothetical model and validates causal 
      relationships among ICMs. Logistic regression showed that installing hand wash 
      stations in the emergency room (p = 0.012, odds ratio = 1.07) was the only ICM 
      significantly associated with the protection of HCWs from acquiring the SARS virus. 
      The structural equation modelling results showed that the most important 
      contributing factor (highest proportion of effectiveness) was installation of a 
      fever screening station outside the emergency department (51%). Other measures 
      included traffic control in the emergency department (19%), availability of an 
      outbreak standard operation protocol (12%), mandatory temperature screening (9%), 
      establishing a hand washing setup at each hospital checkpoint (3%), adding 
      simplified isolation rooms (3%), and a standardized patient transfer protocol (3%). 
      Installation of fever screening stations outside of the hospital and implementing 
      traffic control in the emergency department contributed to 70% of the effectiveness 
      in the prevention of SARS transmission. Our approach can be applied to the 
      evaluation of control measures for other epidemic infectious diseases, including 
      swine flu and avian flu.

LID - 10.1108/S1474-823120190000018013 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a major cause of concern because of the 
      high levels of associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. In addition, children and 
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients are more vulnerable to these infections due to 
      low levels of immunity. Various medical interventions and statistical process 
      control techniques have been suggested to counter the spread of these infections and 
      aid early detection of an infection outbreak. Methods such as hand hygiene help in 
      the prevention of HAIs and are well-documented in the literature. This chapter 
      demonstrates the utilization of a systems methodology to model and validate factors 
      that contribute to the risk of HAIs in a pediatric ICU. It proposes an approach that 
      has three unique aspects: it studies the problem of HAIs as a whole by focusing on 
      several HAIs instead of a single type, it projects the effects of interventions onto 
      the general patient population using the system-level model, and it studies both 
      medical and behavioral interventions and compares their effectiveness. This 
      methodology uses a systems modeling framework that includes simulation, risk 
      analysis, and statistical techniques for studying interventions to reduce the 
      transmission likelihood of HAIs.

AB  - Models have played an important role in policy development to address the COVID-19 
      outbreak from its emergence in China to the current global pandemic. Early 
      projections of international spread influenced travel restrictions and border 
      closures. Model projections based on the virus's infectiousness demonstrated its 
      pandemic potential, which guided the global response to and prepared countries for 
      increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Tracking the impact of distancing and 
      movement policies and behaviour changes has been critical in evaluating these 
      decisions. Models have provided insights into the epidemiological differences 
      between higher and lower income countries, as well as vulnerable population groups 
      within countries to help design fit-for-purpose policies. Economic evaluation and 
      policies have combined epidemic models and traditional economic models to address 
      the economic consequences of COVID-19, which have informed policy calls for easing 
      restrictions. Social contact and mobility models have allowed evaluation of the 
      pathways to safely relax mobility restrictions and distancing measures. Finally, 
      models can consider future end-game scenarios, including how suppression can be 
      achieved and the impact of different vaccination strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of 
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea with peak incidence in late winter or early autumn. 
      Although CDI is commonly associated with hospitals, community transmission is 
      important. AIM: To explore potential drivers of CDI seasonality and the effect of 
      community-based interventions to reduce transmission. METHODS: A mechanistic 
      compartmental model of C. difficile transmission in a hospital and surrounding 
      community was used to determine the effect of reducing transmission or antibiotic 
      prescriptions in these settings. The model was extended to allow for seasonal 
      antibiotic prescriptions and seasonal transmission. FINDINGS: Modelling antibiotic 
      seasonality reproduced the seasonality of CDI, including approximate magnitude 
      (13.9-15.1% above annual mean) and timing of peaks (0.7-1.0 months after peak 
      antibiotics). Halving seasonal excess prescriptions reduced the incidence of CDI by 
      6-18%. Seasonal transmission produced larger seasonal peaks in the prevalence of 
      community colonization (14.8-22.1% above mean) than seasonal antibiotic 
      prescriptions (0.2-1.7% above mean). Reducing transmission from symptomatic or 
      hospitalized patients had little effect on community-acquired CDI, but reducing 
      transmission in the community by ≥7% or transmission from infants by ≥30% eliminated 
      the pathogen. Reducing antibiotic prescription rates led to approximately 
      proportional reductions in infections, but limited reductions in the prevalence of 
      colonization. CONCLUSION: Seasonal variation in antibiotic prescription rates can 
      account for the observed magnitude and timing of C. difficile seasonality. Even 
      complete prevention of transmission from hospitalized patients or symptomatic 
      patients cannot eliminate the pathogen, but interventions to reduce transmission 
      from community residents or infants could have a large impact on both hospital- and 
      community-acquired infections.

AB  - This paper proposes a dynamic model to describe and forecast the dynamics of the 
      coronavirus disease COVID-19 transmission. The model is based on an approach 
      previously used to describe the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic. 
      This methodology is used to describe the COVID-19 dynamics in six countries where 
      the pandemic is widely spread, namely China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the 
      USA. For this purpose, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
      Control (ECDC) are adopted. It is shown how the model can be used to forecast new 
      infection cases and new deceased and how the uncertainties associated to this 
      prediction can be quantified. This approach has the advantage of being relatively 
      simple, grouping in few mathematical parameters the many conditions which affect the 
      spreading of the disease. On the other hand, it requires previous data from the 
      disease transmission in the country, being better suited for regions where the 
      epidemic is not at a very early stage. With the estimated parameters at hand, one 
      can use the model to predict the evolution of the disease, which in turn enables 
      authorities to plan their actions. Moreover, one key advantage is the 
      straightforward interpretation of these parameters and their influence over the 
      evolution of the disease, which enables altering some of them, so that one can 
      evaluate the effect of public policy, such as social distancing. The results 
      presented for the selected countries confirm the accuracy to perform predictions.
