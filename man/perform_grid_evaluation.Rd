\arguments{
\item{records}{A fully labelled Annotation data set (data frame or a path to
a Excel / CSV file).}

\item{sessions_folder}{A path to a folder where to store the grid search
results.}

\item{prev_classification}{An Annotation data set or file with labelled
records. The labels in this data set will be used as ground truth for the
\code{records} file, but the records themselves will not be used.}

\item{n_init}{A vector of numbers enumerating the size of the initial
training set. The initial training set simulates the initial manual
labelling of records used to train the model. It is generated by the
\code{records} data set selecting records in descending order.}

\item{pos_mult, n_models, resample, pred_quants}{A vector of values for each
parameter. For \code{pred_quants} a list of vectors. \See
\code{\link{enrich_annotation_file}} for more details.}

\item{limits}{The conditions on which a CR cycle is stopped. See
\code{\link{enrich_annotation_file}}.}
}
\value{
A message with the number of parameter combinations evaluated.

\description{
The performance of the framework, measured as Sensitivity (rate of relevant
record found over all relevant records) and Efficiency (one minus the ratio
of manually reviewed records) is strongly impacted by a number of parameters.
}
\details{
These parameters are related to the framework only and independent by the
specific Bayesian classification method used (which itself has other specific
parameters). The parameters are the following:

\itemize{ \item \code{n_init}: The number of records in the manually labeled
initial training set. \item \code{n_models}: The number of models trained and
then averaged to stabilize the posterior predictive distribution (PPD). \item
\code{resample}: Whether to bootstrap the data between model retraining if
the number of models is more than one. \item \code{pos_mult}: Oversampling
rate of the positive labeled records. \item \code{pred_quants}: The quantiles
used to summarise the records' PPD and built the Uncertainty zone. }

Check \code{\link{enrich_annotation_file}} for more insight about their
influence on the framework and the classification results. Since all records
are pre-labelled, the manual review phase is performed automatically.

The algorithm starts from a fully labelled Annotation set and performs a
Classification/Review cycle for each combination of parameters.

A great number of files will be created (40 GB with the default grid
parameters for a input \code{records} file with 1200 labelled records), one
session folder for each parameter combination. Therefore, be sure to have
enough disk space before starting. Also, keep in mind that a full search may
requires many days, even on powerful computers.
